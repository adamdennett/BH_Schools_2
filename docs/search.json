    "text": "Declaration of Interests\nSince putting the first tranche of evidence together, a few people have asked me if I have a child that will be affected by the proposed changes. I do. We live very close to both Dorothy Stinger and Vardean Schools and it is absolutely the case that I would consider a few minutes walk to those schools a preferable option for her. As such, be mindful of the risk of bias in what I present and make up your own minds from the evidence. But I would hope that what comes below is as objective as it can be and the questions posed constructive for the inevitable debate such proposals will cause. I am a resident of Brighton and Hove and have a professional interest in how we can make better use of data and evidence to inform public policy.\nI will also be very happy to work with the Council to help produce a more comprehensive analysis relative to the proposals presented and should they be willing to share their data with me. Please just get in contact via the email address above.\n\n\nAbout Me\nI am Professor of Urban Analytics at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London. My work profile can be accessed here: https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/28795-adam-dennett\nI’m a geographer with an interest in using data and quantitative methods to understand how people and the systems they create, work, and to use this information to make better decisions about the places we live in - frequently this draws me to urban contexts and applied settings."

    "section": "The PAN Problem(s)",
    "text": "The PAN Problem(s)\n\nPAN Background\nIt has become clearer to me over the last week that one of the big issues in this whole consultation process is the PAN - both the total PAN in different years (which relates to population projections produced by the Council), and the individual school-level PANs (which affect how many pupils a school can admit at year 7). I will explore both of these dimensions, but first some local background:\nA school cannot legally admit fewer children than its PAN where pupils wish to attend the school. The PAN is initially determined (initially) by the physical size of the school by the Government’s Net Capacity Assessment Programme, but it is not set in stone and can be reduced or increased according to demand. Physically larger schools may have artificially higher PANs even when lived pupil numbers are low.\n\nIn most secondary schools in Brighton (Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill) the PAN is set by the council.\nReligious and Free Schools such as Cardinal Newman and King’s School are allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t (presently) intervene.\nAcademies (Brighton Aldridge Community Academy - BACA, and Portslade Aldridge Community Academy - PACA) are also allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t intervene.\n\nOne issue is that PANs for all schools contribute to the overall total number of ‘places’ in the City - but these don’t necessarily reflect pupils or their distribution (see my last paper if you want to know about geographic distribution). So if the Council is determined to reduce the number of places (PANs) in the city, if the Religious Schools and the Academies refuse to reduce their PANs and the council is wedded to reducing numbers, the only way it can do this is by cutting, proportionally, MORE places from Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill than it would have done if it could control PANs everywhere. At least, that is the way they are operating at the moment - as we will see below, there are other options.\nIn the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024, Councillor Haver* (*again, I think that was her name) raised a point that a Government White Paper is on the horizon which may give local authorities the power to control ALL PANs in the near future - this could alleviate some of the issues I am about to describe, but at the moment, nothing can be done by the council to affect PANS in some schools in the city."

This represents 14% of the total places available.\nAs an interesting aside, we know from the 2021 Census that 30.9% of the population of Brighton identify as Christian - https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/religion/religion-tb/christian?lad=E06000043 - if we believe wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom - 13% of Christians in the UK are Catholic. So if we apply that percentage to Brighton, we can expect 3.9% of the population to be Roman Catholic. But 14% of the school places can be reserved for Catholic Children as a priority. I’ll just leave that there to sink in!"

    "text": "PANs vs Applications and Intake\nThe graph below in Figure 2 includes exactly the same numbers as above, but this time contextualises them relative to the total number of applications each school had in 2024 and the number of places that were actually offered to students that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - PAN 2024 relative to counts of total applications and offers in the same year\nA couple of things to point out:\n\nTotal Applications include all 1st, 2nd and 3rd choices for each school. It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially artificially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity. Longhill had a PAN of 270 and a total offer count of 94. Almost three times fewer students attending than there were places available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Relative School Popularity (School 2024 Application to 2024 PAN ratio divided by Average 2024 Brighton Application to PAN ratio)\nAnother way of looking at Applications vs PANs is take the ratio of applications into PAN and compare this with the city average. In the graph in Figure 3 above, the data has been rescaled (code in the github link) so that anything > 0 is greater popularity relative to other schools in the city, and anything < 0 is less popular.\nInterestingly, we can see that Kings School - the smallest in the city in terms of places available with a PAN of 165, is relatively the most popular, Longhill, on the other hand, is relatively the least popular even after scaling according to the city average."

Taking relative popularity as shown in Figure 3 above, and using that to scale up and down the PAN according the level of popularity in 2024.\n\nComparing the PAN 2026 and PAN 2026 Scaled Popularity columns, we can see the effect this would have on different school PANs.\nThe PANs for Dorothy Strings, Varndean, Hove Park, Kings, and Varndean would all increase by quite large numbers of pupils, reflecting their popularity and accommodating demand.\nThe PANs for Blatchington Mill would reduce almost in line with proposals, Cardinal newman, already with a high PAN, would remain similar, and Patcham would remain virtually the same.\nThe PANs for BACA, PACA and Longhill would decline quite considerably and to the point where they would not be viable schools.\n\nAs stated at the top, this is merely illustrative and NOT in any form a recommendation, but it is useful to explore how the reality of school popularity would change the PANs across the city if it were used.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 2 - Scaled by Evenly\n\nWhat would happen if the council reduced PANs down for each school, but did so evenly across the whole city, according to their current distributions? i.e. dividing each school PAN 2004 by the total Brighton PAN in 2024 and simply multiplying that proportion by the 2026 Brighton Total PAN. Again, I know these don’t fit into multiples of 30, but help for illustration.\nWhat this scenario is useful for is exploring is the impact of some schools being able to opt out of reducing the PANs. If all things were equal, the 2026 Scaled Even PAN would be the same as the Council 2026 PAN.\nAs we can see, things are not equal. Part of this, of course, it due to the fact mentioned earlier that BACA, PACA, Cardinal Newman and Kings set their own PANs at the moment and the Council can’t change this.\nHowever, we can start to see which schools are hit harder by the intractability of not being able to make the non-council run schools take their fair share of the hit. .\n\nBlatchington Mill’s PAN is 15 pupils lower than expected\nLonghill is 17 students lower than expected\nDorothy Stringer 15 students lower\nVarndean at 15/16 students lower.\n\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - the Kings Scenario\n\nThis scenario takes a little explaining which I will do below, but the outcome is:\n\nMost schools in the city don’t need to alter their 2026 PANs from current levels at all\nNo school in the City has a PAN lower than the demonstrably viable 165 PAN that Kings School already has (hence the scenario name)\nPANs are more closely aligned with demand, although a number of schools are ‘donating to the system’ by having PANs considerably lower than their demand levels would suggest"

    "text": "pan2024S vs Applications and Intake\nThe graph below includes exactly the same numbers as above, but this time contextualises them relative to the total number of applications each school had in 2024 and the number of places that were actually offered to students that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of things to point out:\n\nTotal Applications include all 1st, 2nd and 3rd choices for each school. It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially artificially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of looking at Applications vs PANs is take the ratio of applications into PAN and compare this with the city average. This has been rescaled so that anything > 0 is greater popularity relative to other schools in the city, and anything < 0 is less popular."

    "text": "Interpretation\n\nWe can see from the evidence above that PANS for schools in the city bear little or no relation to the popularity of the schools in 2024, as evidenced through their application figures. In fact, for the most popular schools, their first-preference applications are far in excess of the places they have been allocated by the council - their PANS could easily be much higher, relative to other schools in the City.\nSome schools have PANs far in excess of their popularity which affects the rest of the system negatively. PANs matter when you have more demand than places as you can’t go any higher. When you have less demand than places in one school, the PAN is entirely irrelevant for the school (if you’ve only given out 94 offers, it doesn’t matter if your PAN is 270 or 2700!) but HUGELY relevant for the rest of the schools in the system as the number of pupils they can take in is reduced."

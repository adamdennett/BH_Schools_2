    "text": "Declaration of Interests\nSince putting the first tranche of evidence together, a few people have asked me if I have a child that will be affected by the proposed changes. I do. We live very close to both Dorothy Stinger and Vardean Schools and it is absolutely the case that I would consider a few minutes walk to those schools a preferable option for her. As such, be mindful of the risk of bias in what I present and make up your own minds from the evidence. But I would hope that what comes below is as objective as it can be and the questions posed constructive for the inevitable debate such proposals will cause. I am a resident of Brighton and Hove and have a professional interest in how we can make better use of data and evidence to inform public policy.\nI will also be very happy to work with the Council to help produce a more comprehensive analysis relative to the proposals presented and should they be willing to share their data with me. Please just get in contact via the email address above.\n\n\nAbout Me\nI am Professor of Urban Analytics at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London.

This is raw, largely unedited and very much ‘beta’ work - but is is a start and something that will get the conversation between the council and the citizens of Brighton heading, hopefully, in a more positive direction. There will be errors, there are some un-filtered bits (there have been many late nights this week!). Thanks to all those people who have already helped by contributing to the online conversation this week and messaged me with incredibly useful information and encouragement. I know we can reach a good solution together."

    "section": "The PAN Problem(s)",
    "text": "The PAN Problem(s)\n\nPAN Background\nIt has become clearer to me over the last week that one of the big issues in this whole consultation process is the PAN - both the total PAN in different years (which relates to population projections produced by the Council), and the individual school-level PANs (which affect how many pupils a school can admit at year 7). I will explore both of these dimensions, but first some local background:\nA school cannot legally admit fewer children than its PAN where pupils wish to attend the school. The PAN is determined (initially) by the physical size of the school by the Government’s Net Capacity Assessment Programme, but it is not set in stone and can be reduced or increased according to demand. Physically larger schools may have artificially higher PANs even when lived pupil numbers are low.\n\nIn most secondary schools in Brighton (Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill) the PAN is set by the council.\nReligious and Free Schools such as Cardinal Newman and King’s School are allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t (presently) intervene.\nAcademies (Brighton Aldridge Community Academy - BACA, and Portslade Aldridge Community Academy - PACA) are also allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t intervene.\n\nOne issue is that PANs for all schools contribute to the overall total number of ‘places’ in the City - but these don’t necessarily reflect pupils or their distribution (see my last paper if you want to know about geographic distribution). So if the Council is determined to reduce the number of places (PANs) in the city, if the Religious Schools and the Academies refuse to reduce their PANs and the council is wedded to reducing numbers, the only way it can do this is by cutting, proportionally, MORE places from Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill than it would have done if it could control PANs everywhere. At least, that is the way they are operating at the moment - as we will see below, there are other options.\nIn the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024, Councillor Haver* (*again, I think that was her name, not 100% sure) raised a point that a Government White Paper is on the horizon which may give local authorities the power to control ALL PANs in the near future - this could alleviate some of the issues I am about to describe, but at the moment, nothing can be done by the council to affect PANS in some schools in the city."

This represents 14% of the total places available.\nAs an interesting aside, we know from the 2021 Census that 30.9% of the population of Brighton identify as Christian - https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/religion/religion-tb/christian?lad=E06000043 - if we believe wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom - 13% of Christians in the UK are Catholic. So if we apply that percentage to Brighton, we can expect 3.9% of the population to be Roman Catholic. But 14% of the school places in the city can be reserved for Catholic Children as a priority. I’ll just leave that there to sink in!"

    "text": "PANs vs Applications and Intake\nThe graph below in Figure 2 includes exactly the same numbers as above, but this time contextualises them relative to the total number of applications each school had in 2024 and the number of places that were actually offered to students that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - PAN 2024 relative to counts of total applications and offers in the same year\nA couple of things to point out:\n\nTotal Applications include all 1st, 2nd and 3rd choices for each school. It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices (well, just 1st choice, actually) in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity. Longhill had a PAN of 270 and a total offer count of 94. Almost three times fewer students attending than there were places available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Relative School Popularity (School 2024 Application to 2024 PAN ratio divided by Average 2024 Brighton Application to PAN ratio)\nAnother way of looking at Applications vs PANs is to take the ratio of applications to PAN and compare this with the city average - this is a form of standarisation to allow more meaningful comparison where underlying number vary. In the graph in Figure 3 above, the data has been rescaled (code in the github link) so that anything > 0 is greater popularity relative to other schools in the city, and anything < 0 is less popular.\nInterestingly, we can see that Kings School - the smallest in the city in terms of places available with a PAN of 165, is relatively the most popular, Longhill, on the other hand, is relatively the least popular even after scaling according to the city average. Remember this for later on."

Again, I know these don’t fit into multiples of 30, but help for illustration.\nWhat this scenario is useful for is exploring is the impact of some schools being able to opt out of reducing thir PANs. If all things were equal, the 2026 Scaled Even PAN would be the same as the Council 2026 PAN.\nAs we can see, things are not equal. Part of this, of course, it due to the fact mentioned earlier that BACA, PACA, Cardinal Newman and Kings set their own PANs at the moment and the Council can’t change this.\nHowever, we can start to see which schools are hit harder by the intractability of not being able to make the non-council run schools take their fair share of the hit.\n\nBlatchington Mill’s PAN is 15 pupils lower than expected\nLonghill is 17 students lower than expected\nDorothy Stringer 15 students lower\nVarndean at 15/16 students lower.\n\nThe presence of schools in the system that can set their own PANs, unfairly disadvantages other schools who can’t in this scenario.\nWe can see that more-or-less what the council are proposing - factoring out the schools they can’t control - is something close to this equal reduction scenario, with Patcham perhaps being a little more equal than the others. However, equality is quite different from equity, which pays attention to different levels of need.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - the Kings Scenario\n\nThis scenario takes a little explaining which I will do below. One way of thinking about this scenario is it is the EQUITY scenario. It pays more attention to equality but also pays some attention to need as defined by demand for places. It is designed to offer an alternative to focusing just on popularity or equality. The outcomes of this scenario are:\n\nMost schools in the city don’t need to alter their 2026 PANs from current levels at all.\nNo school in the City has a PAN lower than the demonstrably viable 165 PAN that Kings School already has (hence the scenario name).\nPANs are more closely aligned with demand, although a number of schools are ‘donating to the system’ - doing their bit for the good of the whole school system in the city by having PANs considerably lower than their demand levels would suggest, allowing less popular schools to retain viability.\n\n\nBelow, some more context to this problem:\n\nSmall School Viability - the BACA and Longhill challenge\nIn the Town Hall face-to-face meeting on Tuesday, Cllr Taylor stated two relevant things:\n1) The Labour Council campaigned on a manifesto that promised that it would not close a school within Brighton and Hove.\n2) That it was his view that a year 7 PAN of lower than 180 would not be possible for a viable school that could remain open.\nThe latter is tied intrinsically to the former with these two statements, but is this really the case? Let’s unpick this a little and zoom in on the second of the statements.\n\n\nSmall Schools in England and Wales\nThe Government provides data on all schools in England and Wales through their edubase dataset, published annually. https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/ - the database is in the data folder which will allow you to recreate all of this analysis at home with the github code links above.\nIn order that we are comparing like-with-like, let’s only look at open state-funded 11-16 schools in England and Wales. The histogram below shows the distribution of the number of pupils in these schools. The red and cyan lines show the number of pupils at Longhill and PACA respectively (included in the histogram distribution).\nI have not included BACA or Kings in the histogram as they are 11-19 schools and thus not directly comparable, however I have included their numbers as indicative vertical lines on the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Histogram showing the distribution, by total numbers of pupils recorded in the school in 2024, of all open, 11-16 state funded secondary schools in England and Wales.\n\nWhat we can see from the histogram in Figure 6 is that despite the lowest pupil numbers in the city, Longhill and BACA are not outlier schools nationally. Indeed quite the opposite, they fall somewhere near the middle of the distribution of all comparable schools, perhaps slightly on the left of the distribution, so below average, but most people observing the graph would agree that they are pretty average sized schools.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nTotal size, is of course, somewhat different to PAN, but for a school with 5 year-groups (Yr 7 to Yr 11) and equal numbers of pupils in each year (which would be the case for popular schools that hit their PAN every year), if the PAN was set at 165 (the same as Kings in 2024) the total school population would be 825. Longhill currently has a population of - checks figures - 825.\nThe national distribution of comparable schools shows that the small schools in Brighton are not ‘small schools’ just small relative to the city.\nIt is abundantly clear from the evidence above that schools even smaller than the smallest in Brighton are viable. Even if the PANs in the small schools dropped lower than I am recommending currently (165) to, say, a 4-form entry of 150 (a reasonable scenario) - this would equate to a school size of 750 pupils or the pink vertical line on this histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the argument for closing schools in Brighton and Hove with low numbers stack up?\nThe council has repeated cited at the in person consultation meeting I attended and again in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024 that it is not sustainable to have schools with low numbers of pupils. In the Scrutiny meeting, Councillor Haver (*check name) asked a question about the minimum viability of schools.\nCouncillor Taylor and Richard Barker responded that is was their view that 180 pupils was the minimum single year PAN they would consider viable.\nGiven the evidence above, it would appear that they are mistaken in this view.\n\nA large number of comparable 11-16 schools in England and Wales (495 if you count them) are operating with smaller numbers of students than Longhill and BACA.\nWithin Brighton itself, the Kings School, a thriving and demonstrably viable school in the North of the city, is doing very well with a PAN of 165.\nEven if Longhill and BACA reduced their PANs to a 4-form entry of 150 - something I am not advocating for here - they would still not be uncommonly small in England and Wales terms.\n\nNow, of course, there are financial intricacies to which I am not privy and potentially other considerations, but a question we would all be forgiven for asking at this point is:\n\nIs there a particular failure of competency within Brighton and Hove Council that is considers itself unable to contemplate running schools in the city of a size that a large proportion of other local authorities in the country appear to manage quite happily?\nWhy does the council consider itself unable to manage what other councils are able to achieve?\nWould a sensible course of action be to consult with other local authorities who are more experienced in dealing with some smaller schools in their portfolio?\n\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - Continued\nIt is clear then, that there is no justifiable reason why Brighton and Hove Council can’t run some schools with PANs lower than 180. I have shown how PANs of even 150 are viable in a national context.\nRecap\n\nWe know that if PANs bore any relation to demand (PAN 2026 scaled by popularity, below), schools like Longhill, BACA and PACA would not be viable in 2026.\nWe know that if we just reduce PANs evenly across the system in 2026, popular and in-demand schools will be turning away pupils they could easily accomodate (and we’ve not even got the the impacts of the new FSM policy and the exodus of pupils from the Private sector after the introduction of VAT)\n\n\nBack to the PANs and Demand\n\n# Create kable table\nkable(admissions_with_sum, caption = \"Council PAN and PAN Scenarios\")\n\n\nCouncil PAN and PAN Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\nType\nPAN 2024\nPAN 2026\nPAN 2030\nPAN 2026 Scaled Popularity\nPAN 2026 Scaled Even\nPAN 2026 Kings Scenario\n\n\n\n\nBlatchington Mill School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n240\n289\n315\n330\n\n\nBrighton Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n180\n180\n180\n57\n172\n165\n\n\nCardinal Newman Catholic School\nVoluntary aided school\n360\n360\n360\n388\n343\n360\n\n\nDorothy Stringer School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n270\n380\n315\n330\n\n\nHove Park School and Sixth Form Centre\nCommunity school\n180\n180\n180\n250\n172\n180\n\n\nKing’s School\nFree schools\n165\n165\n165\n275\n157\n165\n\n\nLonghill High School\nCommunity school\n270\n240\n180\n55\n257\n165\n\n\nPatcham High School\nCommunity school\n225\n225\n180\n228\n214\n225\n\n\nPortslade Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n220\n220\n220\n128\n210\n220\n\n\nVarndean School\nCommunity school\n300\n270\n240\n393\n286\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n2560\n2440\n2215\n2443\n2441\n2440\n\n\n\n\n\nA more equitable solution to the PAN problem that pays due consideration to demand, while also acknowledging the reality of pupil numbers for all schools across this city, can be represented by my PAN 2026 Kings Scenario above.\nIn this scenario:\n\nMost schools in the city keep PANs that are in line with their 2024 levels. Many of these schools could accommodate more, but in the interests of continuing the viability of other schools in the system, they are in effect donating PAN to less popular schools.\nThe recommendation is that BACA in an ideal world would reduce its PAN to 165 - well in excess of a demand-based PAN, but lower than its current level. I acknowledge that under the current system this is not possible, but at just 15 students, bear with me - we’re within margins of error in the whole system now.\nEvery other school in Brighton EXCEPT Longhill, keeps its PANs at the 2024 Level. For most of these schools, as I have said, this is a reduction in PAN relative to popularity. I propose Longhill reduces its PAN to 165 - the same level as Kings School - and still WELL IN EXCESS of its actual student intake in 2024 of 94 students.\n\nI believe this proposal is not both workable, sensible and importantly, equitable, recognising both the need to keep all schools open in the city and the recognition of demand in other places. It will also buy the council the time it needs to fully engage in a more comprehensive review of all evidence from all of the inter-connected domains while hitting its own overall PAN targets.\nI am aware that some may feel that despite all of the evidence above, I am picking on Longhill, but to be totally honest, I don’t think my brain had even acknowledged its existence until this week - I knew there was a school in Rottingdean, but that was all I knew. But its importance has started to shine through while carrying out data analysis on the topic over the last week or so. So let’s explore the Longhill problem in a little more detail."

It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially artificially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of looking at Applications vs PANs is take the ratio of applications into PAN and compare this with the city average. This has been rescaled so that anything > 0 is greater popularity relative to other schools in the city, and anything < 0 is less popular."

In fact, for the most popular schools, their first-preference applications are far in excess of the places they have been allocated by the council - their PANS could easily be much higher, relative to other schools in the City.\nSome schools have PANs far in excess of their popularity which affects the rest of the system negatively. PANs matter when you have more demand than places as you can’t go any higher. When you have less demand than places in one school, the PAN is entirely irrelevant for the school (if you’ve only given out 94 offers, it doesn’t matter if your PAN is 270 or 2700!) but HUGELY relevant for the rest of the schools in the system as the number of pupils they can take in is reduced."

    "section": "The Longhill Problem",
    "text": "The Longhill Problem\n\nRecent Numbers\n\nLonghill is a school on the Eastern geographic edge of the city in Rottingdean (for a map see my last analysis here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html#current-situation)\nThe intakes of all secondary schools in the city are a matter of public record and can be obtained from the Council’s webpages, for example - https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/allocation-factsheet-year-7-places-september-2024\nYou can see that in 2024, Longhill admitted (or at least offered places to) 94 students. This was relative to a PAN in 2024 of 270 places. Put another way, the school admitted almost three-times fewer students than its PAN would have allowed it to.\nClearly this is not ideal for Longhill as the funding that schools get is tied to pupil numbers (if you are interested in exactly how this works - HT James for this - see here). But what does it mean for the rest of the school system in Brighton, is this good or bad news?\nIt’s bad. In 2024, Brighton Council set a hard ceiling of 2560 for its PAN - schools are legally not allowed to admit more pupils than their PAN (although Varndean did due to special circumstances). If one school in the system has a much higher PAN than it can reasonably be expected to hit, the net effect is it takes potential capacity away from other schools. It’s a classic example of a zero-sum game.\nAs I mentioned earlier in this piece, PANs are originally derived from a physical measure of school size - the volume of the buildings, pretty much. So it might be the case that they are maxed out in terms of their physical limits - so not quite a zero-sum game in this context.\nIn 2024 it could be argued that Longhill isn’t leeching capacity from other schools if other schools are already maxed out (and in 2024 I think most in the city were), but this picture changes in a declining school roll environment.\nUnder current Council proposals for 2026 in Option A, Longhill’s PAN reduces slightly to 240, but is it reasonable to expect anything like this number of students to attend? If it is not, and other schools in the system already in high demand are being forced to reduce their PANs as well, then we are now in a situation where Longhill is unfairly taking capacity away from schools where demand is higher.\n\n\n\nWhy are Longhill’s 2024 numbers low - is this an anomaly and might we expect them to change?\n\nPeople might reasonably ask, what if 2024 is just an out-of-character blip? Something related to its recent downgrading from an Ofsted rating of “Good” in 2018? to “Requires Improvement” in 2024?\nOr what if it is just a brief demographic anomaly? I heard someone say in the consultation meeting “Longhill used to be the best school in the city!” - If its numbers were boosted, would it not just return to its former glory?\nTo try and answer these questions, we need to dig back into history a little. What were it’s numbers like in previous years?\n\nAs an aside, this is a plea again to Brighton Council - please sort your data out!! I had to trawl through about 11 different web-pages, open several different PDF documents *NB, PDFs are a TERRIBLE way to store data - webpages not much better. Spreadsheets, csv files, or, whisper it - an API - would all be better. If it weren’t for my tame AI helper, I’d still be processing these data next month!\nAll of my code for processing these data and the original source files can be accessed here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/data_processing_scripts.html\n\n\nSchool Application and Offer History Across Brighton\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Total Applications to all schools in the City, 2014-2024\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Total Offers to Pupils by School, 2014-2024\nFigures 7 and 8 above show the published total application and offer data by school for the city between 2014-2024 - a few points to note\n\nYou will notice that over the 11-year period, BACA is persistently at the bottom of the rankings on both measures and in recent years has been joined by Longhill\nVarndean, Dorothy Stringer and Cardinal Newman are fairly consistently near the top on both measures.\n\nPatterns can be a little difficult to discern with all schools on the graph, so lets extract our smallest schools in the city:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted.\n\nInterpretation\nWhat Figures 9 and 10 above show more clearly are the 11-year linear trends associated with applications to the smallest schools in the city. These have some properties of note:\n\nWhile in terms of both applications and offers, there is a degree of bouncing around in the numbers, the linear trends are revealing.\nFor Longhill, the trend in both applications and offers is of secular decline.\nLonghill was rated as “Good” by Ofsted in 2018 which is likely to account for the sudden up-tick in applications and offers in 2019. However, it remained “Good” (at least as far as the official ofsted reports were concerned) until March 2024 - a 6-year period of being “Good” that also saw a year-on-year decline in both applications and offers.\nSimilarly, prior to 2018, Longhill also had a period of “required improvement” when both its applications and admissions were trending higher.\nBoth of these observations are evidence that it is not just the quality of the education on offer which might be resulting in the decline (in student number terms) of the school. It is likely (and I will explore this in the future) that these are longer-term demographic trends in the city, combined with the physically remote location of the school.\nOne analogy of the Council’s current approach to Longhill could be that it is taking on the role of King Canute trying to hold back the inevitable demographic tide - a battle that it will not win as these things are long-term, slow-dynamic systems.\nIt should be noted that the Council can do nothing about the location of the school - powerful as it might be, even it cannot move mountains or indeed rolling chalk hills! There’s little it can do about demography either - ageing, migration, fertility and mortality are largely out of its control. I can build new housing, and this could be something that might help arrest the decline of the school a little, but this is also a project outside of the remit of the education team.\nPerhaps most noticeable about Longhill’s decline is that since 2020, it’s applications have been in a slow, steady and regular decline. This suggests to me the trend is here to stay and very much supports my contention that a PAN of 270 is far too high both now and in the near and long-term future.\nTo be fair to the Council, the appear to have noticed some of this themselves and in 2030 have proposed under Option A, to reduce Longhill’s PAN to 180, but from the evidence I have presented here, I think this is too late. The PAN needs to be reduced more dramatically and sooner.\nWhile Longhill’s PAN remains artificially high - and FAR higher than it’s likely student numbers even under the most optimistic of future scenarios, in a city system of overall declining student numbers and where most of these numbers are actually Longhill’s to lose, the net effect is that Longhill is artifically forcing other schools in the system to lower their numbers when they don’t need to.\nJust to note again, if you are coming in with numbers lower than your PAN, the PAN is utterly meaningless for you as an institution, but potentially catastrophic for other schools in the system who are forced to cut classes when they don’t need to. A more accurate PAN means the rest of the PANs can be spread around more equitably. It is an utter no-brainer to reduce Longhill’s PAN, it will not make their situation any worse than it currently is, but stands to improve the situation for all other schools in the city.\nWe can contrast Longhill’s decline with the rapid ascent of the Kings School. Almost in a mirror of the fortunes of Longhill, Kings School has been on the up. Despite its hard ceiling of a PAN of 165, which you can see coming in to play in 2018 in Figure 10.\nKings School could actually go higher, but it is physically located in an area of the city congested with schools, so I would not advocate for this - where it is on PAN would appear to be sensible.\nA word about BACA - BACA’s numbers are low, but relative to the other small schools in the city, fairly steady. I would view this as encouraging and BACA should be supported to be the important small school serving an important part of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12\n\nBy way of contrast, Figures 11 and 12 show the temporal trends for applications and admissions in some of the more popular schools in the city.\nWhat is noticeable about these schools is their relative consistency. There is some variation and some trending slightly up or slightly down - this will be relevant later when we compare to long-term population trends at the city level, but at the moment we can note that any PAN changes imposed on these schools would run counter to their long-term trends of popularity and viability and I would view it as a negative intervention on the part of the council.\n\n\n\n\nThe Longhill Problem - Conclusions and Recommendations\nI hope that the evidence of longer-term trends presented here helps evidence that Longhill is not being unfairly targeted in this analysis. It has long-term issues which do not appear to be related over the long term to its performance.\nI am aware that what I have presented here will not solve the problems at Longhill - the council will have to think long and hard about a strategy of managed decline in numbers that can still support the school to remain viable.\nIt’s also true that Longhill’s student population problems might get even worse under the new scheme to allow FSM students (40% of the Longhill population!) to select schools in other parts of the city should they wish. These students will go off and mix in more affluent parts of the city and improve segregation and integration - something that the Council’s other expert, Professor Stephen Gorard presented as having universally positive outcomes in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024. However, the solution to this problem is not to bus students long-distances back the other way. Indeed Prof Gorard also said very clearly that ’any programmes of mixing and integration would need careful thought so as to cause MINIMUM DISRUPTION.\nI have evidenced above that Longhill can be viable as a smaller school and I think it should be supported to be a thriving smaller school, but it is not viable as a large school, no matter what ill-conceived policy might be imposed to force it to be one. Anything like this would run against a huge weight of evidence and will be ultimately destined to fail, generating more problems than it solves in the process.\nOne final point of note is that the council needs to come to terms with the reality that Longhill is already a very different school in size and demography than it was perhaps in the time when Cllr Taylor was a student. Yes, it still occupies the same site, but the site does not suit the school it is any more. This is actually a fantastic opportunity should the council choose to grasp it. It owns a large site in an affluent part of the city that should it choose to reduce the size of the estate, then it could use this resource for any number of productive initiatives, including affordable housing. This is an opportunity that needs the kind of thinking beyond narrow educational boundaries I have already discussed.\nI would urge the council to consider this very carefully indeed. I will re-iterate this:\nLonghill does NOT need to close but it must be helped to manage its long-term structural decline in pupil numbers over the coming years. This problem will not be solved by bussing students in from other parts of the city, the problem is too big and too systemic for this to be a viable fix, but a smaller school may actually present opportunities for the council it has not yet considered."

These have some properties of note:\n\nWhile in terms of both applications and offers, there is a degree of bouncing around in the numbers, the linear trends are revealing.\nFor Longhill, the trend in both applications and offers is of secular decline.\nLonghill was rated as “Good” by Ofsted in 2018 which is likely to account for the sudden up-tick in applications and offers in 2019. However, it remained “Good” (at least as far as the official ofsted reports were concerned) until March 2024 - a 6-year period of being “Good” that also saw a year-on-year decline in both applications and offers.\nSimilarly, prior to 2018, Longhill also had a period of “required improvement” when both its applications and admissions were trending higher.\nBoth of these observations are evidence that it is not just the quality of the education on offer which might be resulting in the decline (in student number terms) of the school. It is likely (and I will explore this in the future) that these are longer-term demographic trends in the city, combined with the physically remote location of the school.\nOne analogy of the Council’s current approach to Longhill could be that it is taking on the role of King Canute trying to hold back the inevitable demographic tide - a battle that it will not win as these things are long-term, slow-dynamic systems.\nIt should be noted that the Council can do nothing about the location of the school - powerful as it might be, even it cannot move mountains or indeed rolling chalk hills! There’s little it can do about demography either - ageing, migration, fertility and mortality are largely out of its control. I can build new housing, and this could be something that might help arrest the decline of the school a little, but this is also a project outside of the remit of the education team.\nPerhaps most noticeable about Longhill’s decline is that since 2020, it’s applications have been in a slow, steady and regular decline. This suggests to me the trend is here to stay and very much supports my contention that a PAN of 270 is far too high both now and in the near and long-term future.\nTo be fair to the Council, the appear to have noticed some of this themselves and in 2030 have proposed under Option A, to reduce Longhill’s PAN to 180, but from the evidence I have presented here, I think this is too late. The PAN needs to be reduced more dramatically and sooner.\nWhile Longhill’s PAN remains artificially high - and FAR higher than it’s likely student numbers even under the most optimistic of future scenarios, in a city system of overall declining student numbers and where most of these numbers are actually Longhill’s to lose, the net effect is that Longhill is artifically forcing other schools in the system to lower their numbers when they don’t need to.\nJust to note again, if you are coming in with numbers lower than your PAN, the PAN is utterly meaningless for you as an institution, but potentially catastrophic for other schools in the system who are forced to cut classes when they don’t need to.

    "text": "How do the Council come up with total PANs for the city anyway? And are these numbers reliable?\nGood question - I’m glad you asked! I promise this is one final push, stick with me!\nIn my last piece I implored the Council to publish as much information as possible, including their methodology for estimating (present day) and projecting (into the future) pupil populations in the city. I will ask again - PLEASE PUBLISH YOUR DATA AND METHODOLOGY.\nYear 7 PANs relate directly to the Population of children who will be going into Year 7 in the next school year. For most children when they start, they will be 11 years old. So how do we know how many there are?\nI know a little bit about population estimation and projection - in the dim and distant past (while we were still in Europe - remember those days?!) - I worked on an EU Funded project to project populations in different parts of the European Union, called DEMIFER - here is some work we did on London, if you are interested - https://archive.espon.eu/sites/default/files/attachments/DEMIFER_Deliverable12_12_UKI1_UKI2Inner_and_Outer_London.pdf\nAnyway as my mentor at the time Professor Phil Rees used to say - “All projections are wrong, but some are more wrong than others!” - sage words that have stuck with me ever since.\nIn the face-to-face council meeting many people attended on Tuesday, someone asked about the validity of the numbers and the response was “our projections are reliable” or something to that effect. I could almost hear Phil Rees fall off his chair in Leeds!\nSo how do I think these numbers are arrived at and do I believe them? In the absence of a published methodology we will have to guess. If I were the council this is how I would do it:\n\nProbably my most reliable source of data is the information I already know about how many children I have in year 6 in the state school sector - i.e. within the council run primary schools in the city. This is a pretty good start. Depending on when in the year I count those year 6 children before they start year 7 things might change - a greater or lesser number may move away, some may arrive either from within the country or from abroad. Sadly some might die. Some might already be in the city, perhaps at a private prep school, but their parents decide the state sectors is a better (or cheaper) option at secondary school. Some may go the opposite way from a state primary into the private sector. More or less though, most children in year 6 in the state sector will more into year 7 in the state sector and adding all of these up will give a pretty decent estimate of the total PAN in the city.\n\nWhat I have described above is at the high City level - The council have a further advantage of knowing WHERE in the city these primary school children live. They know which catchments they live in, so they have a pretty good idea which secondary schools they are most likely to apply to.\nIt would be brilliant if the council were able to release at the neighbourhood level, counts of year 6 (10 year old) pupils across the city into the public domain. This is useful as we can then compare these data with other datasets such as the Census which can be used as both cross-validation but also allow us to estimate how many non-state-school children of the same age are in different areas. This is important as, as we shall see, occasionally there are shocks to the system which can throw our estimates out a bit.\n\nNormally, we would expect our attempts at projecting populations into the future to get worse, the further away from the last reliable point of real data. This is why all Office for National Statistics (ONS) Projections are re-based (corrected) every time there is a census.\nMost projections start life with the Census. In the UK, the last Census was in 2021 (you can probably remember filling it out as there wasn’t much else to do during the Pandemic!) and only happens every 10 years.\nTo try and fill the void between Censuses, various different sources of population data can feed in to try and account for things like internal migration, international migration births, deaths, refugees, asylum seekers, and visitors who switch to stayers. One of the most commonly used sources are GP patient registers and these are pretty good for some types of people (kids, old people, women) but pretty bad for young men (who often are slow to register with a GP once they move).\nTo help with its PAN projections, on p255 of the report on this page - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/mgChooseDocPack.aspx?ID=11316 - it’s clear that the council uses the Schools Census and GP register data, with some adjustments applied for children attending the two Religious Schools (although not private Schools) in the city."

    "text": "PAN(demonium?)\n\nPAN Background\nIt has become clearer to me over the last week that the Published Admission Numbers (PAN) for both individual schools and the City are a massive part - if not THE most important part of this whole issue and I hope what I present below will convince you of this too.\nThe PAN is really two problems - the city-level PAN for different years (which relates to population projections produced by the Council), and the individual school-level PANs (which affect how many pupils a school can admit at year 7) which control school intake. I will explore both of these dimensions, but first some local background:\nA school cannot legally admit fewer children than its PAN where pupils wish to attend the school. The PAN is determined (initially) by the physical size of the school by the Government’s Net Capacity Assessment Programme, but it is not set in stone and can be reduced or increased according to demand. Physically larger schools may have artificially higher PANs even when lived pupil numbers are low - and we will see why this is important later.\n\nIn most secondary schools in Brighton (Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill) the PAN is set by the council.\nReligious and Free Schools such as Cardinal Newman and King’s School are allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t (presently) intervene.\nAcademies (Brighton Aldridge Community Academy - BACA, and Portslade Aldridge Community Academy - PACA) are also allowed to set their own PANs and the council can’t intervene.\n\nOne issue is that PANs for all schools contribute to the overall total number of ‘places’ in the City - but these don’t necessarily reflect pupils or their distribution (see my last paper if you want to know about geographic distribution). So if the Council is determined to reduce the number of places (PANs) in the city because of a declining population of children, if the Religious Schools and the Academies refuse to reduce their PANs and the council needs to reduce the total, the only way it can do this is by cutting, proportionally, MORE places from Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill than it would have done if it could control PANs everywhere. At least, that is the way they are operating at the moment.\nI say at the moment as In the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024, Councillor Haver* (*again, I think that was her name, not 100% sure) raised a point that a Government White Paper is on the horizon which may give local authorities the power to control ALL PANs in the near future - this could alleviate some of the issues I am about to describe, but at the moment, nothing can be done by the council to affect PANS in some schools in the city."

These new boundaries are slightly different and will have slightly different pupil numbers within catchments, but they are similar enough to the present catchment to hopefully still be able to make reasonable comparison. If more and better data arrive in the future, I will of course re-visit and update.\n\nThe graph above is a representation of the data provided in slide 11 of the materials supplied by the council. Under “Option A”, it’s clear to see that the council proposes to reduce PANS for all Council run schools in the city at two points in the future, first in 2026 (which they are also proposing to coincide with a boundary change - I will not cover boundary changes in this piece, but will do something on boundaries and geography in the future) and then again in 2030 (unclear if boundary changes are also on the cards at this point).\nBelow we see the same data, but this time in a table with the Council City-Wide PAN targets they have set at the bottom. Next to these council PAN targets are three illustrative scenarios I have produced to explore the decisions the council is making and shine a light the political choices (for this is not a neutral process, far from it!) they are making through their PAN setting. The final column is a Scenario I am calling the “Kings 2026 PAN Scenario” and I believe is the scenario which could be the key to unlocking the challenges the city is currently facing. I will explain why this is below.\n\nTable 1 - 2024 PAN and Various PAN scenarios\n\n\n\nCouncil PAN and PAN Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\nType\nPAN 2024\nPAN 2026\nPAN 2030\nPAN 2026 Scaled Popularity\nPAN 2026 Scaled Even\nPAN 2026 Kings Scenario\n\n\n\n\nBlatchington Mill School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n240\n289\n315\n330\n\n\nBrighton Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n180\n180\n180\n57\n172\n165\n\n\nCardinal Newman Catholic School\nVoluntary aided school\n360\n360\n360\n388\n343\n360\n\n\nDorothy Stringer School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n270\n380\n315\n330\n\n\nHove Park School and Sixth Form Centre\nCommunity school\n180\n180\n180\n250\n172\n180\n\n\nKing’s School\nFree schools\n165\n165\n165\n275\n157\n165\n\n\nLonghill High School\nCommunity school\n270\n240\n180\n55\n257\n165\n\n\nPatcham High School\nCommunity school\n225\n225\n180\n228\n214\n225\n\n\nPortslade Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n220\n220\n220\n128\n210\n220\n\n\nVarndean School\nCommunity school\n300\n270\n240\n393\n286\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n2560\n2440\n2215\n2443\n2441\n2440\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Council Proposed PANs\n\nI have made a number of earlier observations which look at proposed PAN reductions for different schools in the city level relative to the population distribution of pupils and have shown that there are more severe reductions in areas of higher demand and less severe reductions in areas of lower demand, so I won’t go over that again here.\nWhat I will comment on here, however, are the PAN levels relative concepts of popularity, equality and equity - a different, but vitally important angle.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 1 - Scaled by Popularity\n\nFirstly, I should point out that these scenarios below are illustrative - I know that school entry numbers are predicated on multiples of 30, but these are designed to show the effect of different policies and priorities on these numbers.\nTaking relative popularity as shown in Figure 3 above, and using that to scale up and down the PAN according the level of popularity in 2024, we see:\n\nThe PANs for Dorothy Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Kings, and Varndean in 2026 would all increase by quite large numbers of pupils, reflecting their popularity and accommodating demand.\nThe PANs for Blatchington Mill would reduce almost in line with proposals, Cardinal newman, already with a high PAN, would remain similar, and Patcham would remain virtually the same.\nThe PANs for BACA, PACA and Longhill would decline considerably and to the point where they would not be viable schools.\n\nAs stated at the top, this is merely illustrative and NOT in any form a recommendation, but it is useful to explore how the reality of school popularity would change the PANs across the city if it were used.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 2 - Scaled by even (equal) reductions\n\nWhat would happen if the council reduced PANs down for each school, but did so evenly across the whole city, according to their current distributions? i.e. dividing each school PAN 2004 by the total Brighton PAN in 2024 and simply multiplying that proportion by the 2026 Brighton Total PAN. Again, I know these don’t fit into multiples of 30, but help for illustration.\nWhat this scenario is useful for is exploring is the impact of some schools being able to opt out of reducing thir PANs. If all things were equal, the 2026 Scaled Even PAN would be the same as the Council 2026 PAN.\nAs we can see, things are not equal. Part of this, of course, it due to the fact mentioned earlier that BACA, PACA, Cardinal Newman and Kings set their own PANs at the moment and the Council can’t change this.\nHowever, we can start to see which schools are hit harder by the intractability of not being able to make the non-council run schools take their fair share of the hit.\n\nBlatchington Mill’s PAN is 15 pupils lower than expected\nLonghill is 17 students lower than expected\nDorothy Stringer 15 students lower\nVarndean at 15/16 students lower.\n\nThe presence of schools in the system that can set their own PANs, unfairly disadvantages other schools who can’t in this scenario.\nWe can see that more-or-less what the council are proposing - factoring out the schools they can’t control - is something close to this equal reduction scenario, with Patcham perhaps being a little more equal than the others. However, equality is quite different from equity, which pays attention to different levels of need.\nAnother important point to note is that there is a very large difference between a PAN set according to popularity and a pan set according to equality. While we wouldn’t want to just consider current popularity for various reasons (popularity ebs and flows, it reduces diversity, crowds out those who are different etc.) equally, setting PANs equally fails to acknowledge there there are any reasonable justifications for some variation in the system.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - the Kings Scenario\n\nThis scenario takes a little explaining which I will do below. One way of thinking about this scenario is it is the EQUITY scenario. It pays more attention to equality but also pays some attention to need as defined by demand for places. It is designed to offer an alternative to focusing just on popularity or equality. The outcomes of this scenario are:\n\nMost schools in the city don’t need to alter their 2026 PANs from current levels at all.\nNo school in the City has a PAN lower than the demonstrably viable 165 PAN that Kings School already has (hence the scenario name).\nPANs are more closely aligned with demand, although a number of schools are ‘donating to the system’ - doing their bit for the good of the whole school system in the city by having PANs considerably lower than their demand levels would suggest, allowing less popular schools to retain viability.\n\n\nBelow, some more context to this problem:\n\nSmall School Viability - the BACA and Longhill challenge\nIn the Town Hall face-to-face meeting and again in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024 on Tuesday, Cllr Taylor stated two relevant things:\n\nThe Labour Council campaigned on a manifesto that promised that it would not close a school within Brighton and Hove.\nThat it was his view that a year 7 PAN of lower than 180 would not lead to a viable school that could remain open.\n\nThe latter is tied intrinsically to the former with these two statements, but is this really the case? Let’s unpick this a little and zoom in on the second of the statements.\n\n\nSmall Schools in England and Wales\nThe Government provides data on all schools in England and Wales through their edubase dataset, published annually. https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/ - the database is in the data folder which will allow you to recreate all of this analysis at home with the github code links above.\nIn order that we are comparing like-with-like, let’s only look at open state-funded 11-16 schools in England and Wales. The histogram below shows the distribution of the number of pupils in these schools. The red and cyan lines show the number of pupils at Longhill and PACA respectively (included in the histogram distribution).\nI have not included BACA or Kings in the histogram as they are 11-19 schools and thus not directly comparable, however I have included their numbers as indicative vertical lines on the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Histogram showing the distribution, by total numbers of pupils recorded in the school in 2024, of all open, 11-16 state funded secondary schools in England and Wales.\n\nWhat we can see from the histogram in Figure 6 is that despite the lowest pupil numbers in the city, Longhill and BACA are not outlier schools nationally. Indeed quite the opposite, they fall somewhere near the middle of the distribution of all comparable schools, perhaps slightly on the left of the distribution, so below average, but most people observing the graph would agree that they are pretty average sized schools.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nTotal size, is of course, somewhat different to PAN, but for a school with 5 year-groups (Yr 7 to Yr 11) and equal numbers of pupils in each year (which would be the case for popular schools that hit their PAN every year), if the PAN was set at 165 (the same as Kings in 2024) the total school population would be 825. Longhill currently has a population of - checks figures - 825.\nThe national distribution of comparable schools shows that the small schools in Brighton are not ‘small schools’ just small relative to the city.\nIt is abundantly clear from the evidence above that schools even smaller than the smallest in Brighton are viable. Even if the PANs in the small schools dropped lower than I am recommending currently (165) to, say, a 4-form entry of 150 (a reasonable scenario) - this would equate to a school size of 750 pupils or the pink vertical line on this histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the argument for closing schools in Brighton and Hove with low numbers stack up?\nTo reiterate, the council has repeated cited at the in person consultation meeting I attended and again in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024 that it is not sustainable to have schools with low numbers of pupils. In the Scrutiny meeting, Councillor Haver (*check name) asked a question about the minimum viability of schools.\nCouncillor Taylor and Richard Barker responded that is was their view that 180 pupils was the minimum single year PAN they would consider viable.\nGiven the evidence above, it would appear that they are mistaken in this view. This is absolutely crucial as, as I will show below, it is the case that it is approprate, fair and equitable to reduce the PAN of at least one school in the city to a level very slightly below 180 (and still well above their intake for the last 5 years) for the benefit of all schools in the city. Futhermore, the evidence above proves:\n\nA large number of comparable 11-16 schools in England and Wales (495 if you count them) are operating with smaller numbers of students than Longhill and BACA.\nWithin Brighton itself, the Kings School, a thriving and demonstrably viable school in the North of the city, is doing very well with a PAN of 165.\nEven if Longhill and BACA reduced their PANs to a 4-form entry of 150 - something I am not advocating for here - they would still not be uncommonly small in England and Wales terms. So there is a lot of room for manoeuvre if only the council could think creatively.\n\nNow, of course, there are financial intricacies and challenges to which I am not privy and potentially other considerations, but a question we would all be forgiven for asking at this point is:\n\nIs there a particular skills deficit within Brighton and Hove Council that it considers itself unable to contemplate running schools in the city of a size that a large proportion of other local authorities in the country appear to manage quite happily?\nWhy does the council consider itself unable to manage what other councils are able to achieve?\nWould a sensible course of action be to consult with other local authorities who are more experienced in dealing with some smaller schools in their portfolio?\nIf there are good arguments against this, what are they, and what evidence can you provide to support those arguments?\n\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - Continued\nIt is clear then, that there is no justifiable reason why Brighton and Hove Council can’t run some schools with PANs lower than 180. I have shown how PANs of even 150 are viable in a national context.\nRecap\n\nWe know that if PANs bore any relation to demand (PAN 2026 scaled by popularity, below), schools like Longhill, BACA and PACA would not be viable in 2026.\nWe know that if we just reduce PANs evenly across the system in 2026, popular and in-demand schools will be turning away pupils they could easily accommodate (and we’ve not even got the the impacts of the new FSM policy and the exodus of pupils from the Private sector after the introduction of VAT)\n\n\nBack to the PANs and Demand\n\n# Create kable table\nkable(admissions_with_sum, caption = \"Council PAN and PAN Scenarios\")\n\n\nCouncil PAN and PAN Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\nType\nPAN 2024\nPAN 2026\nPAN 2030\nPAN 2026 Scaled Popularity\nPAN 2026 Scaled Even\nPAN 2026 Kings Scenario\n\n\n\n\nBlatchington Mill School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n240\n289\n315\n330\n\n\nBrighton Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n180\n180\n180\n57\n172\n165\n\n\nCardinal Newman Catholic School\nVoluntary aided school\n360\n360\n360\n388\n343\n360\n\n\nDorothy Stringer School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n270\n380\n315\n330\n\n\nHove Park School and Sixth Form Centre\nCommunity school\n180\n180\n180\n250\n172\n180\n\n\nKing’s School\nFree schools\n165\n165\n165\n275\n157\n165\n\n\nLonghill High School\nCommunity school\n270\n240\n180\n55\n257\n165\n\n\nPatcham High School\nCommunity school\n225\n225\n180\n228\n214\n225\n\n\nPortslade Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n220\n220\n220\n128\n210\n220\n\n\nVarndean School\nCommunity school\n300\n270\n240\n393\n286\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n2560\n2440\n2215\n2443\n2441\n2440\n\n\n\n\n\nA more equitable solution to the PAN problem that pays due consideration to demand, while also acknowledging the reality of pupil numbers for all schools across this city, can be represented by my PAN 2026 Kings Scenario above.\nIn this scenario:\n\nMost schools in the city keep PANs that are in line with their 2024 levels. Many of these schools could accommodate more, but in the interests of continuing the viability of other schools in the system, they are in effect donating PAN to less popular schools.\nThe recommendation is that BACA in an ideal world would reduce its PAN to 165 - well in excess of a demand-based PAN, but lower than its current level. I acknowledge that under the current system this is not possible, but at just 15 students options probably exist to transfer un-used PAN to larger schools as has been done with Varndean in the last, bear with me - we’re within margins of error in the whole system now.\nEvery other school in Brighton EXCEPT Longhill, keeps its PANs at the 2024 Level. For most of these schools, as I have said, this is a reduction in PAN relative to popularity. I propose Longhill reduces its PAN to 165 - the same level as Kings School - and still WELL IN EXCESS of its actual student intake in 2024 of 94 students - and as we will see later, well in excess of its actual student number for the LAST 5 YEARS.\n\nI believe this proposal is not both workable, sensible and importantly, equitable, recognising both the need to keep all schools open in the city and the recognition of demand in other places. It will also buy the council the time it needs, should it wish to try other equity improving initiatives around diversity and segregation to fully engage in a more comprehensive review of all evidence from all of the inter-connected domains, while hitting its own overall PAN targets if that is an operational challenge. Essentially, while not everybody wins, there is a much lower proportion of losers under this strategy.\nI am aware - and indeed steeling myself for the inevitable - that some may feel that despite all of the evidence above, I am somehow picking on Longhill, but to be totally honest, I don’t think my brain had even acknowledged its existence until this week - yes, I knew there was a school in Rottingdean/Ovingdean, but that was all I knew - I didn’t know any of its background. But its importance has started to shine through incredibly brightly while carrying out data analysis on the topic over the last week or so. So let’s explore the Longhill problem in a little more detail."

    "text": "Comparing Brighton PAN Projections with ONS Sub-National Population Projections\nVerifying the validity of the Population Projections and associated PAN projections produced by the Council is important. If projections are out, this could have existential impacts on schools, so getting it right is important. Further context to this concern is given in 2015 where a review of Brighton’s pupil projection methodology was carried out - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=47946 - and found issues with the methodology employed. While I am sure the council has acted upon the recommendations of the report, I can find no detailed documentation describing how their current projections are calculated.\nWhile I have no reason to believe the Council employs a poor methodology to project its city-level and catchment-specific student populations and PAN, without documentation and methodology to support the numbers, we don’t really know. Verification is a basic part of due diligence, especially if disruptive changes hinge on the numbers produced.\nIt should be noted that given the importance of accurate projections for a range of applications, from estimating school numbers to projecting elderly care need, a number of Local Authorities in the UK turn to established professionals for assistance. Companies like Edge Analytics in Leeds provide these services - a legitimate question to ask is whether the reason for Brighton not producing methodology documentation is because they buy in professional services, and if so, from whom?\nIn the UK, the most reliable population projection data available are the ONS Sub-National Population Projections - SNPP. As national statistics, these are the benchmark, so any projections that deviate, not necessarily in absolute terms, but certainly in relative terms, need careful justification and evidencing.\nIn Brighton, tucked away on p255 of another (!!!) PDF document - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/mgChooseDocPack.aspx?ID=11316 - can be found the official (as of 22nd January 2024) Pupil Population Projection Numbers. I have been able to compare them with the ONS projections for 11 year olds below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Comparison of Brighton PAN projections and ONS Sub-National Population Projections.\nThere are, as ever, a few things to note here:\n\nFirstly the ONS SNPP numbers are higher - this is to be expected as the Brighton numbers should be adjusted down to only account for pupils in the state sector - home schooled pupils and private school pupils are likely the main reason for discrepancies but others probably exist.\nOne small point is these numbers from the published Brighton documentation from Jan 2024 are different from the numbers that appear in the consultation PowerPoint. Projections do change, but without a published methodology, the reasons behind this are opaque.\nIn 2024 the difference is 659 people aged 11 across the city - quite a large number if we think about this in terms of class sizes of 30 and the PANs for individual schools seen earlier. This difference grows and contracts a little until 2030 when it is at 563, but then gets much larger to 878 by 2034.\nWhat this trend shows - and you can see it in the graph - is that Brighton and Hove Council are projecting numbers of school children in the city to decline FASTER and more severely than the Official ONS National Statistics.\nPut another way, if we apply the ONS annual population change rate to the Brighton starting PAN in 2024, we end up with quite different population estimates - see Figure 14 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Population Projects with Brighton PAN tracking ONS annual rate\n\nWe can see that by applying the ONS rate - a legitimate and defensible methology, we can actually end up with plausible, but quite different population estimates.\nUnder this methodology, in 2026 we have a PAN of 2347 (vs original Brighton PAN of 2270 - i.e. we have gained 77 students, magically. Roll forward to 2030 - the next big PAN reduction point, and we have 127 more students.\n\nMy point here, is not to say that applying the ONS rate to the Brighton population is better - it is almost certainly an inferior methodology (although, who knows, it might not be!) My point is to say - without the full methodology published by the council, they might as well be plucking the numbers out of thin air!\nMy hasty estimates above are totally plausible. They apply a method which is common the world over in projections, but they arrive very different numbers at crucial years which could mean the difference between schools losing entire classes from their entry cohorts, or having a sound argument for increasing capacity.\n\nIndependent Schools\nOn final note on this topic needs to go to the role that Private/Independent Schools play in the Brighton System.\nIt is difficult to determine how many Brighton resident children attend independent schools within the city, but it will be a measured in the hundreds judging by the differences the the PAN and the ONS 11 year old estimates above.\nThe Labour Party (the National one) are planning to introduce VAT on Private School fees - https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/08/vat-private-school-fees-no-delay-says-minister - no-one knows that the impact of this will in terms of adding more students who parents can no longer afford the costs, into the state system, but it will be non-zero.\nThis of course, would result in more students in the state school system and correspondingly any city-wide PAN projections needing to be uplifted."

    "title": "Brighton and Hove Secondary School Admissions Proposal - New Analysis and an Alternative Proposal",
    "section": "The Longhill Challenge",
    "text": "The Longhill Challenge\n\nRecent Numbers\n\nLonghill is a school on the Eastern geographic edge of the city in Rottingdean (for a map see my last analysis here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html#current-situation)\nThe intakes of all secondary schools in the city are a matter of public record and can be obtained from the Council’s webpages, for example - https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/allocation-factsheet-year-7-places-september-2024\nYou can see that in 2024, Longhill admitted (or at least offered places to) 94 students. This was relative to a PAN in 2024 of 270 places. Put another way, the school admitted almost three-times fewer students than its PAN would have allowed it to.\nClearly this is not ideal for Longhill as the funding that schools get is tied to pupil numbers (if you are interested in exactly how this works - HT James for this - see here). But what does it mean for the rest of the school system in Brighton, is this good or bad news?\nIt’s bad. In 2024, Brighton Council set a hard ceiling of 2560 for its PAN - schools are legally not allowed to admit more pupils than their PAN (although Varndean did due to special circumstances). If one school in the system has a much higher PAN than it can reasonably be expected to hit, the net effect is it takes potential capacity away from other schools. It’s a classic example of a zero-sum game.\nAs I mentioned earlier in this piece, PANs are originally derived from a physical measure of school size - the volume of the buildings, pretty much. So it might be the case that they are maxed out in terms of their physical limits - so not quite a zero-sum game in this context.\nIn 2024 it could be argued that Longhill isn’t leeching capacity from other schools if other schools are already maxed out (and in 2024 I think most in the city were), but this picture changes in a declining school roll environment.\nUnder current Council proposals for 2026 in Option A, Longhill’s PAN reduces slightly to 240, but is it reasonable to expect anything like this number of students to attend? If it is not, and other schools in the system already in high demand are being forced to reduce their PANs as well, then we are now in a situation where Longhill is unfairly taking capacity away from schools where demand is higher.\n\n\n\nWhy are Longhill’s 2024 numbers low - is this an anomaly and might we expect them to change?\n\nPeople might reasonably ask, what if 2024 is just an out-of-character blip? Something related to its recent downgrading from an Ofsted rating of “Good” in 2018? to “Requires Improvement” in 2024?\nOr what if it is just a brief demographic anomaly? I heard someone say in the consultation meeting “Longhill used to be the best school in the city!” - If its numbers were boosted, would it not just return to its former glory?\nTo try and answer these questions, we need to dig back into history a little. What were it’s numbers like in previous years?\n\nAs an aside, this is a plea again to Brighton Council - please sort your data out!! I had to trawl through about 11 different web-pages, open several different PDF documents *NB, PDFs are a TERRIBLE way to store data - webpages not much better. Spreadsheets, csv files, or, whisper it - an API - would all be better. If it weren’t for my tame AI helper, I’d still be processing these data next month!\nAll of my code for processing these data and the original source files can be accessed here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/data_processing_scripts.html\n\n\nSchool Application and Offer History Across Brighton\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Total Applications to all schools in the City, 2014-2024\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Total Offers to Pupils by School, 2014-2024\nFigures 7 and 8 above show the published total application and offer data by school for the city between 2014-2024 - a few points to note\n\nYou will notice that over the 11-year period, BACA is persistently at the bottom of the rankings on both measures and in recent years has been joined by Longhill\nVarndean, Dorothy Stringer and Cardinal Newman are fairly consistently near the top on both measures.\n\nPatterns can be a little difficult to discern with all schools on the graph, so lets extract our smallest schools in the city:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted.\n\nInterpretation\nWhat Figures 9 and 10 above show more clearly are the 11-year linear trends associated with applications to the smallest schools in the city. These have some properties of note:\n\nWhile in terms of both applications and offers, there is a degree of bouncing around in the numbers, the linear trends are revealing.\nFor Longhill, the trend in both applications and offers is of secular decline.\nLonghill was rated as “Good” by Ofsted in 2018 which is likely to account for the sudden up-tick in applications and offers in 2019. However, it remained “Good” (at least as far as the official ofsted reports were concerned) until March 2024 - a 6-year period of being “Good” that also saw a year-on-year decline in both applications and offers.\nSimilarly, prior to 2018, Longhill also had a period of “required improvement” when both its applications and admissions were trending higher.\nBoth of these observations are evidence that it is not just the quality of the education on offer which might be resulting in the decline (in student number terms) of the school. It is likely (and I will explore this in the future) that these are longer-term demographic trends in the city, combined with the physically remote location of the school.\nOne analogy of the Council’s current approach to Longhill could be that it is taking on the role of King Canute trying to hold back the inevitable demographic tide - a battle that it will not win as these things are long-term, slow-dynamic systems.\nIt should be noted that the Council can do nothing about the location of the school - powerful as it might be, even it cannot move mountains or indeed rolling chalk hills! There’s little it can do about demography either - ageing, migration, fertility and mortality are largely out of its control. I can build new housing, and this could be something that might help arrest the decline of the school a little, but this is also a project outside of the remit of the education team.\nPerhaps most noticeable about Longhill’s decline is that since 2020, it’s applications have been in a slow, steady and regular decline. This suggests to me the trend is here to stay and very much supports my contention that a PAN of 270 is far too high both now and in the near and long-term future.\nTo be fair to the Council, the appear to have noticed some of this themselves and in 2030 have proposed under Option A, to reduce Longhill’s PAN to 180, but from the evidence I have presented here, I think this is too late. The PAN needs to be reduced more dramatically and sooner.\nWhile Longhill’s PAN remains artificially high - and FAR higher than it’s likely student numbers even under the most optimistic of future scenarios, in a city system of overall declining student numbers and where most of these numbers are actually Longhill’s to lose, the net effect is that Longhill is artifically forcing other schools in the system to lower their numbers when they don’t need to.\nJust to note again, if you are coming in with numbers lower than your PAN, the PAN is utterly meaningless for you as an institution, but potentially catastrophic for other schools in the system who are forced to cut classes when they don’t need to. A more accurate PAN means the rest of the PANs can be spread around more equitably. It is an utter no-brainer to reduce Longhill’s PAN, it will not make their situation any worse than it currently is, but stands to improve the situation for all other schools in the city.\nWe can contrast Longhill’s decline with the rapid ascent of the Kings School. Almost in a mirror of the fortunes of Longhill, Kings School has been on the up. Despite its hard ceiling of a PAN of 165, which you can see coming in to play in 2018 in Figure 10.\nKings School could actually go higher, but it is physically located in an area of the city congested with schools, so I would not advocate for this - where it is on PAN would appear to be sensible.\nA word about BACA - BACA’s numbers are low, but relative to the other small schools in the city, fairly steady. I would view this as encouraging and BACA should be supported to be the important small school serving an important part of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Yearly application trends at four of the larger / more popular schools in the city\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Yearly offer trends at four of the larger / more popular schools in the city\n\nBy way of contrast, Figures 11 and 12 show the temporal trends for applications and admissions in some of the more popular schools in the city.\nWhat is noticeable about these schools is their relative consistency. There is some variation and some trending slightly up or slightly down - this will be relevant later when we compare to long-term population trends at the city level, but at the moment we can note that any PAN changes imposed on these schools would run counter to their long-term trends of popularity and viability and I would view it as a negative intervention on the part of the council.\n\n\n\n\nThe Longhill Challenge - Conclusions and Recommendations\nI hope that the evidence of longer-term trends presented here helps evidence that Longhill is not being unfairly targeted in this analysis. It has long-term issues of declining number which do not appear to be directly related over the long term to its performance - of course more work would need to be done to establish precisely the contributions of demography and performance to this observation.\nI am aware that what I have presented here will not solve the problems at Longhill - the council will have to think long and hard about a strategy of managed decline in numbers that can still support the school to remain viable.\nIt’s also true that Longhill’s student population problems might get even worse under the new scheme to allow FSM students (40% of the Longhill population!) to select schools in other parts of the city should they wish. These students will go off and mix in more affluent parts of the city and improve segregation and integration - something that the Council’s other expert, Professor Stephen Gorard presented as having universally positive outcomes in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024. However, the solution to this problem is not to bus students long-distances back the other way. Indeed Prof Gorard also said very clearly that ’any programmes of mixing and integration would need careful thought so as to cause MINIMUM DISRUPTION.\nI have evidenced above that Longhill can be viable as a smaller school and I think it should be supported to be a thriving smaller school, but it is not viable as a large school, no matter what ill-conceived policy might be imposed to force it to be one. Anything like this would run against a huge weight of evidence and will be ultimately destined to fail, generating more problems than it solves in the process.\nOne final point of note is that the council needs to come to terms with the reality that Longhill is already a very different school in size and demography than it was perhaps in the time when Cllr Taylor was a student. Yes, it still occupies the same site, but the site does not suit the school it is any more.\nThis is actually a fantastic opportunity should the council choose to grasp it. It owns a large site in an affluent part of the city that should it choose to reduce the size of the estate, then it could use this resource for any number of productive initiatives, not limited to but perhaps including affordable housing (although I am aware of the challenges the planning system may through up here). This is an opportunity that needs the kind of thinking beyond narrow educational boundaries I have already discussed.\nI would urge the council to consider this very carefully indeed. I will re-iterate this:\nLonghill does NOT need to close but it must be helped to manage its long-term structural decline in pupil numbers over the coming years. This problem will not be solved by bussing students in from other parts of the city, the problem is too big and too systemic for this to be a viable fix, but a smaller school may actually present opportunities for the council it has not yet considered."

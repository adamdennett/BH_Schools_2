    "text": "Declaration of Interests\nSince putting the first tranche of evidence together, a few people have asked me if I have a child that will be affected by the proposed changes. I do. We live very close to both Dorothy Stinger and Vardean Schools and it is absolutely the case that I would consider a few minutes walk to those schools a preferable option for her. As such, be mindful of the risk of bias in what I present and make up your own minds from the evidence. But I would hope that what comes below is as objective as it can be and the questions posed constructive for the inevitable debate such proposals will cause. I am a resident of Brighton and Hove and have a professional interest in how we can make better use of data and evidence to inform public policy.\nI will also be very happy to work with the Council to help produce a more comprehensive analysis relative to the proposals presented and should they be willing to share their data with me. Please just get in contact via the email address above.\n\n\nAbout Me\nI am Professor of Urban Analytics at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London. My work profile can be accessed here: https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/28795-adam-dennett\nI’m a geographer with an interest in using data and quantitative methods to understand how people and the systems they create, work, and to use this information to make better decisions about the places we live in - frequently this draws me to urban contexts and applied settings."

    "section": "The PAN Problems",
    "text": "The PAN Problems\nIt has become clearer to me over the last week that one of the big issues in this whole consultation process is the PAN - both the total PAN in different years, which relates to population projections produced by the Council, and the individual school-level PANs which affect how many pupils a school can admit at year 7. I will take each in turn, but first some local background.\nIn most secondary schools in Brighton (Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill) the PAN is set by the council.\nReligious and Free Schools such as Cardinal Newman and King’s School are allowed to set their own PANs.\nAcademies (Brighton Aldridge Community Academy - BACA, and Portslade Aldridge Community Academy - PACA) are also allowed to set their own PANs.\nOne issue is that PANs for all schools contribute to the overall total number of places in the City. So if the Council is determined to reduce the number of places (PANs) in the city, if the Religious Schools and the Academies refuse to reduce their PANs and the council is wedded to reducing numbers, the only way it can do this is by cutting, proportionally, MORE places from Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Blatchington, Patcham, Longhill than it would have done if it could control PANs in all state funded schools in the City.\nIn the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024, Councillor (Haver* NB check name, this is what it sounded like live) raised a point that a Government White Paper is on the horizon which may give local authorities the power to control ALL PANs in the near future - this could alleviate some of the issues I am about to describe, but at the moment, nothing can be done."

This represents 14% of the total places available.\nAs an interesting aside, we know from the 2021 Census that 30.9% of the population of Brighton identify as Christian - https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/maps/choropleth/identity/religion/religion-tb/christian?lad=E06000043 - if we believe wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom - 13% of Christians in the UK are Catholic. So if we apply that percentage to Brighton, we can expect 3.9% of the population to be Roman Catholic. But 14% of the school places can be reserved for Catholic Children as a priority. I’ll just leave that there to sink in!"

It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially artificially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity."

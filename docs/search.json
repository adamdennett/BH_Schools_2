While not perfect, this will be a pretty accurate representation of where the children who were going to attend secondary school in 2024 live.\nThe black dots are the locations of the Secondary Schools in the city and the black boundaries are the current catchment areas surrounding these schools, for context.\nYou can see in the background for this map, there is also a road network. And if we know roughly how fast people walk and if we have information on the bus network in the city and the bus timetables associated with each bus-stop in the city (to give us an idea of how fast the buses travel), we can generate some pretty good estimates of how long it would take children in the orange circles to get to the black dots.\n\nWe can use this information to create a ‘model’ (a simplified version of reality) of Brighton - our “Brightopia” model and we can use this model to help us answer: If the only thing that mattered was how long it took to get to school, which schools would the children in the city choose to attend?"

    "section": "Running the Brightopia model",
    "text": "Running the Brightopia model\nIn my day job, I build these kinds of models all the time. They are called ‘spatial interaction models’ and they are used to understand how people, money, commodities etc. move around in cities. They are used to understand how people get to work, how they get to the shops, how they get to school, where they spend their money and how they make choices about where they go. Supermarket chains use them to predict store revenues, transport companies use them to predict passenger numbers, and urban planners use them to understand how cities work.\nThe most basic spatial interaction models are sometimes simply referred to as ‘gravity models’. The maths underneath is identical to Sir Isaac Newton’s formula for gravity - the bigger the two objects and the closer they are, the stronger the force between them.\nIf you would like to understand a little more about the theory and the mathematics behind these models - I wrote an explainer some years ago here - https://rpubs.com/adam_dennett/376877\n\nThe model I have decided to run is called a “Production” or “Origin Constrained” model - what this means is that the number of children who can go to each school are constrained to the numbers we know are living in different neighbourhoods in the city.\nThe numbers actually arriving at schools will vary and reflect demand based only on how long it takes to get to those schools. The effect of distance is controlled by what’s known as a ‘distance decay parameter’ and it controls how fast travel declines with increasing distance.\nDistance from home to school is not straight-line distance, but walking or via bus travel times along the real Brighton road network, obtained from Open Street Map. Travel Times are calculated using the R5R package, with bus travel times generated from a GTFS schedule for Brighton (actual bus timetable information and times between stops) from May 2024.\n\nWhich schools students decide to go to is then only determined by the time it takes to get to school from where they live and nothing else. This is a simplification of course - in reality, there are many other factors that determine where children go to school - but it is through this simplification that we uncover the importance of space.\nI have gone a step further and constrained these numbers to the total PAN of 2560 11-year old places in the council’s published material so what we will end up with are estimates that we can compare with actual PAN numbers to see how close we get."

Indeed this is not all that surprising given that many people with children will choose residential locations near to schools if that choice is available to them.\nHove Park School, according to the model, could attract 142 more students than it currently is, due to where it is located. Although from the map of the flow breakdown, it is an artefact of the model that it is drawing these from a wide area due to the comparative accessibility of this part of town (the model has to send all students somewhere and accessible places hoover up a larger share).\nIf distance were the only thing that mattered, Dorothy Stringer would attract 49 fewer pupils than its current PAN. Blatchington Mill, 57 fewer, and Longhill would attract 94 fewer than it currently does. The maps show that Longhill’s location and lack of accessibility means it is only drawing students from a primarily, local area.\nWhat this shows, uneqivocally, is that that many of the observations about Longhill’s declining application and admission numbers in my last piece are not simply down to its performance as many suggest, but a large factor in its problems is its location relative to where children live.\n\nAs it is so far out on its own to the East and as so few pupils live in the vicinity, any pupils it would be getting in excess of this number would be due to non-spatial influences.\n\nLonghill is not in a good location for pupils from Whitehawk. Students in this part of the city are not near any school and the fact they have been forced to attend Longhill rather than a closer school has been terrible for them. Given the number of students in the vicinity of the current Longhill, relative to the number of students in Whitehawk, a utilitarian approach that would reduce travel for the most number of students in the city would be to re-locate the school to the near-East of the city.\nWhat this gravity modelling suggests quite strongly is Longhill would stand a better chance of demographic sustainability if it were re-located, perhaps somewhere to the East of the City, near the General Hospital or the Race Course at the top of Elm Grove. If it were re-located here, it would also stand a much better change of naturally achieving the demographic mix (students from Whitehawk, the ’deans and Hannover would be in the natural geographic catchment for a school here.\n\n\n\nFurther Work\nThis is only a very basic gravity model and it can be extended to develop and even more nuanced picture of school supply and demand in the city. I have not got that far yes as this takes time to do properly - and I have not had time. But I would be more than willing to work with the Council to develop some more nuanced spatial interaction models, calibrated against their data, to help derive a decision support tool which would enable a fully evidenced decision to be made on location and capacity of schools. This work could include, for example:\n\nAn extended gravity model where the Longhill is re-located to other parts of the city. What would demand look like if it were moved to:\n\nThe old COMART site?\nA new site at the top of Elm Grove near the General Hospital or Dobbies?\nDisused farm/warehouse site at the top of Bear Road?\nOr any other potentially viable location.\n\nHow might the demographic mix of a re-located Longhill look? From where would it most likely draw it’s students (in the absence of catchments?)\nA more complex model to explore what happens when we change the attractiveness of schools according to the kinds of factors that parents and students rank highly? Educational outcomes? SEND provision? Green Space?\nA better calibrated model using actual student locations and flow data from the council to explore different\nHow can spatial interaction be used to better inform an alternative to the current catchments? Do we even need catchments at all or can we come up with a much better solution which incorporates distance and socio-demographic diversity AT THE SAME TIME? What would such a system look like?\nI think in the medium term, the council would do well to instigate a commission - and I will happily volunteer to be part of it if they would have me - to look into real useful alternatives to the current catchment system which strike the right balance between the socio-spatial realities of the city and other motivations to improve opportunities for those with the least. It’s clear that the boundaries as implemented in 2008 are not working as intended, so perhaps boundaries and catchments are not the solution at all, and alternatives such as the marginal ballot as suggested by the Sutton Trust are alternatives worth looking into alongside a full range of alternatives. If a balanced view of their efficacy in the specific context Brighton could be developed, then it is more likely that an appropriate long-term solution could be found."

Space/Place/Location matters. It really matters. And to deny this physical fact is akin to claiming the world is flat!\nThe only lasting sustainable solution to the city’s problems in the school system is one that pays full attention to geographic reality while also considering how this geography interacts with disadvantage and opportunities."

    "text": "A Stain on our City? Some Observations\nHopefully what I have shown in this short exercise, is that context is everything.\n\nCompared the the national average for England, Brighton’s attainment at GCSE for pupils on Free School Meals is lower, however, that national average is being pulled up considerably by London, which is performing between 6.5% and 15.1% better than the best-performing non-London region.\nIf Brighton were one of these 33 regions, it woud still be achieving better results for pupils on FSM than 2/3 of other places in England. If we take London out of the equation, it would appear in the top 5.\nRather than being ‘a stain on our city’, it should be regared as a badge of pride that Brighon and Hove is able to achieve such good results for pupils in receipt of Free School Meals, relative to the rest of England.\nIf we look at the attainment gap between those who are on Free School Meals and those who aren’t as well, Brighton still performs far better than average, even with London in the equation. If Brighton were one of the regions above, it would be just outside the top 1/3.\n\nThe characterisation of Brighton and Hove’s ability to help it’s more deprived students as a ‘stain on the city’ is demonstrably unfair. And this kind of ‘cherry picking’ of statistics (where indeed statistics of any kind have been provided) to suit a particular line of argument has, sadly, characterised this whole ‘engagement’ process.\nHowever, this is even more to it than this. That 24% potentially masks some particularly acute problems in parts of the City such as East Brighton - listening to the Class Divide Podcast, this could be as high as 32% in this part of the city. So ‘stain’ rhetoric when tarring the whole city plays a slightly more insidious role. It serves to distract from the very real problems of access and segretation to do exist in some parts of the city in particular concentrations - particularly in Whitehawk, but also in other parts of the city. Casting it as a problem for the whole city, serves the purpose of diverting attention away from the uncomfortable truth this is really a concentrated problem that needs a specific remedy for a particular part of the city - and not the one that’s on offer. And that in large parts of the city, disadvantaged children are doing better than in 2/3 of the rest of the country.\nI know London is an entirely different context in many ways, but we should be striving to achieve something closer to the 42.1% FSM attainment rates achieved in Inner London - West and ignoring where the problems are most acute is not going to be the way to do it. And it absolutely should be in the Council’s mission to improve further, but in doing so, getting a better understanding of the various factors at play in London (demographic, financial, geographical, educational etc.) and the specific routes to success and turnaround is crucial, as then better solutions could be trialled here."

Longhill also appears to have improved to 27%.\n\nHowever, NOTHING HAS CHANGED. It’s the same underlying data for the same schools. The only thing that is different is some statistical averaging. Imagine if we kept expanding the catchments until there was just 1 - covering the whole city. The FSM for this catchment would of course be the city average!\nSo any claims from the council that having larger catchments somehow magically FSM distributions needs to be questioned. If the pupils and the schools stay the same, it’s merely statistical averaging.\nNow, of course, I am fully aware that in having larger catchments and random allocation to schools within those catchments, then there’s a good chance that there will be a lot more mixing, but this will take years to propagate through and the council can’t yet predict how that will play out, so be cautions of justifications based on statistical averaging."

    "section": "History and Futures",
    "text": "History and Futures\nOne question that keeps coming up relates to what the school population of Brighton is going to look like in the future.\nWhile, as I showed in my last piece, it’s fairly certain from ONS projections that the city is going to lose quite a number of young people over the next decade - maybe a couple of thousand - what is not clear is how that will play out across the city. Will it be an even decline, or will some places suffer worse than others?\nThe Office for National Statistics produces a number of data products. Firstly a product called the LSOA population estimates - these are small-area estimates for neighbourhoods and can be examined back in time to look at past changes.\nThe second product is called the sub national population projections - these don’t quite go down to the LSOA level, but are available at the local authority level and go a number of years into the future.\nWhat is noticable is the relative distributions of the LSOA populations don’t change that much over time, so we can use the distributions in the past estimates, to apply to future projections to create a full neighbourhood-level picture of Brighton for a 20 year period.\nOne of my colleagues, Dr Andy Maclachlan, has created an interactive map where you can explore the period from 2011 until 2031 for the city. https://amaclachlan.shinyapps.io/Brighton_school_children_catchments/ - all data have been downloaded from the ONS via the NOMIS website.\nAn alternative view of Andy’s interactive map can be seen in the maps and the plot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to point out is that while numbers in a given neighbourhood may fluctuate a little (a corner of woodingdean had high numbers of 11 year olds in 2012, which have dropped off since), you can see from the maps that, areas don’t change very much relative to each other.\nIn the graph, we can observe that between 2011 and up to 2031, the number of 11 year-olds in the city hit a peak in 2019 with another small peak in 2024, but there is a projected decline of 200-300 students until 2030.\nDemographic trends are long term generally, so the patterns for schools which draw from large parts of the city, can be fairly predictable. In the East of the City, for example, the interactive map shows that in the ‘Deans’ most LSOAs (except for one between Ovingdean and Woodingdean, which might be around 5 11 year-olds higher in 2031 than in 2011) there is nothing to suggest anything other than the same decline experienced elsewhere in the city.\nOne issue with standard choropleth maps such as the ones above, is that there are visual distortions created by the large amounts of green space in parts of Brighton. Open spaces makes zones based on population (like these LSOAs) physically larger which draws your eye to. A truer picture of actual demographic distribution in the city can be seen in maps like the one below.\n\n\nDemographic Distribution and Catchments\nThe crucial thing in Brighton, however, relates to the spatial distribution of school age Children relative to catchments. I posted this map a few days ago and also at the top of this piece, but now I have allowed the different options A, B and C (as well as the current situation described as OptionX in the map to be overlaid.\nIf you play with the layer options on the left you can see how distributions of catchments vary according to the different catchment options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure - - The spatial distribution of 11 year olds in 2024, relative to current secondary school catchment boundaries.\n\nThe circles relate to LSOA neighbourhoods in the city. The numbers relate to the 2024 sub-national population projections at City Level, distributed down to LSOAs using the last know recorded distributions in 2021. There is bound to be some error, but as you will see from the historical 2011 to 2021 patterns shown above and on the interactive site, demographics are stable enough to be confident this is a pretty fair representation of the real distribution of 11 year olds.\nNormally these sorts of data are shown on a choropleth map of contiguous zones, but here I have chosen to take the population-weighted centroids of the LSOA zones and scale those centroid locations according to estimated numbers of 11-year olds. In doing this, the distorting effects of open space are controlled for and a truer picture of the real population distribution in the city can be gained.\nOverlaid onto this map are the current and proposed secondary school catchment boundaries in the city.\nIt becomes very clear that most catchments are well populated although the BACA catchment in the north-east of the city appears to have a low population within its boundary. This is born out in the analysis I conducted in my last piece.\nThe other thing to note is how sparse the Longhill Catchment to the East is, with it clear that other than a small concentration of children to the north in Woodingdean, the majority of the catchment population is made up of children coming from Whitehawk to the West. Without those children from Whitehawk, it would be difficult to see Longhill having enough children to keep running in its current form."

A conservative estimate would be that if the policy is in place for 5 years, this might lead to a minimum of 365 children a day travelling from central Brighton to the East of the City.\n\nHow is this a sustainable or indeed affordable option for the Council?\n\nI have focused on South Brighton in this example (I am running out of time and steam) but the situation might be even worse in North Brighton with students moving around between three schools in the catchment. This would lead to hundreds more children bussing around the city.\n\nAgain, how is this a sustainable or indeed affordable option for the Council?"

    "section": "Review of the Last 3 Weeks",
    "text": "Review of the Last 3 Weeks\nSince the announcement of the ‘engagement exercise’ by the council, and frustrated by the evidence made available, I have made it my mission to try and fill the information vacuum with data and evidence collated, analysed and presented from a variety of different sources.\nHopefully this week, alongside my other two pieces of analysis (here and here), have helped highlight where the real issues in the system are. These can be summarised as:\n\nThe spatial distribution of schools and places available in those schools, relative to where pupils actually live. Some (well, one as we’ll see below) of the schools in Brighton are simply in the wrong place (piece 1).\nIllogical reductions in Published Admission Numbers for some schools and the maintenance of other, relative to current and future demand, driven largely by a desire to artificially prop up a school of the wrong size in the wrong location (piece 2).\n\nUnfortunately, the effort taken in digging through the data and to unearly these issues means that I’ve not yet been able to address some of the other crucial parts of the story. In particular:\n\nThe fact that the educational disadvantage partially caused by the spatial arrangement of current schools, is most keenly felt by those in the city who unfairly suffer from other forms of social and economic disadvantage - in particular residents of Whitehawk whose access to secondary education is poor. The issues raised by Class Divide around the closure of the COMART school in East Brighton in 2005 and their subsequent lack of accessibility to ANY secondary education in the city, let alone high-quality education, is very real.\n\nBut in not being fully honest about all dimensions of problem - or possibly just ignorant of them - and in trying to portray the whole of the Brighton schools system as a problem, and a narrative of the ‘middle classes’ of north Brighton closing ranks to thwart a just cause (rather than a fundamentally flawed process), the whole community has been let down by the Council. I am now even more strongly of the opinion that the ‘solutions’ on the table are nothing of the sort and will only serve to do more harm than good.\n\nMy Current Fears - I hope unfounded\nAt the beginning of the exercise, I had real hope that the lack of information coming from the council was perhaps a mistake - an oversight due to an inexperienced or over-worked team. Unfortunately, as the weeks have gone by, and as I have listened to members of the council during the ‘engagement’ Q&A sessions, the council are giving the impression that the lack of information is intentional. By not engaging with the requests for information and the clearly articulated fears of the community - and at worst, being dismissive of them - it feels like they have already made up their minds. It feels like an engagement in name only. I hope this is not the case.\nHaving reviewed all of the data I have gathered, it has become clear that only one option on the table - Option B (or something which looks a lot like it) - will result in the mass transition of students from the centre of the City, to Longhill in the East. A school which while once an appropriate size for a catchment stretching out towards Peacehaven, thanks to long-term demographic shifts (an ageing population and decline in families) no longer serves its original constituency. In recent years it’s cohorts of students have been swelled by children bussed out from Whitehawk in the East of the City - a demographic sticking plaster made easier to apply thanks to a population with less financial and social capital to resist.\nTo its credit, the Council - if not quite able to own up to its failures in closing COMART in 2005 - at least is now listening to that part of the city and has enacted a new policy to allow the financially worst off students - those on Free School Meals - to choose to study elsewhere in the city, should they wish. However, it’s clear that Option B is also the only option that stands to mitigate the inevitable effects of this policy, which will lead to still more students deserting Longhill. A policy that, if the council do rush through with a consultation immediately after the engagement period ends, won’t have had time to come to fruition or the initial results to be reviewed. It can be the only explanation for the haste with which council is proceeding.\nI fear that in all of this, if the council pushes forward against the increasing weight of evidence, the people they are supposedly championing - those particularly in Whitehawk - will actually lose out in the long term. This is because, as I will show in some new analysis below - Longhill is poorly located and will continue to be poorly located, relative to where pupils live in the city. The council may try to argue that a new housing estate in Ovingdean will generate the demand required to keep Longhill afloat in the medium term, but as the numbers show below, unless this estate is the size of something like Whitehawk (it is far from that) it will be a drop in the ocean and barely move the dial. And the distraction of making a bad catchment system even worse, means that a real, sustainable, long-term, solution will be kicked down the road in favour of a poorly thought through short term solution, which is unlikely to work anyway.\n\n\nMy Hopes\nOn the plus side, it is not too late for the council to take notice of the hundreds of good ideas and suggestions that are now emerging from individuals and self-organised groups in the city. I hope that they really do listen.\nI hope that some of the evidence I have provided to fill the vacuum has helped some people understand what the underlying problem is a little better. And that armed with this information, they have felt emboldened to pose good questions to the council and make their voice heard.\nI hope that the council takes the city up on its offer of help, whether through a Citizens Assembly, through the offers of help from experts who live in the city and care about it deeply.\nIn my last piece I offered the council a viable option which would allow them to slow down and take an evidence-based approach. Myself and other members of the newly formed Parent Support Group intend to present the council with a worked through alternative to their current plans - and “Option D” if you like which will offer both a short-term and longer term sustainable alternatives to those that are currently on the table.\nI hope that our proposals do buy the time the Council needs to do this properly. In my last piece I called for a systems thinking approach and I think this is the only way a lasting and sustainable solution can be reached. This will need to be carried out with a full range of view gathered from a Citizens Assembly - and idea I have seen recently promoted by Class Divide and one which was put to the council the last time they tried to re-draw the catchment boundaries, but one which clearly has not been enacted yet. And the council need to engage with a diverse and full range of expert views. It is great that the view of Prof Gorard and Dr Greaves were heard, and their educational perspective is important, but as I have shown this is as much a problem of geography and community, of flows and interactions, as it is of education. And there are hundreds of other voices with equally important perspectives that need to be heard.\nAdam Dennett 22/10/24"

That’s 73 children just in yr 7 who live West of Queens Park, who would be forced to travel to Longhill. And that’s a conservative estimate.\nPropagate that through for 5 years after the policy implemented and you’ve got something like 365 children a day having to travel from East of Queens Park, across the city to get to school.\nIf a bus has a capacity of around 80. That’s 5 buses to take all of these children east.\n\nTo an extent, this is back of the envelope stuff, but at least gets us to some sort of number for the level of commuting. 50% of those journey’s by car? Get e sense of the level of traffic disruption it would cause."

It’s likely that schools in multi-school catchments may receive both first and second choices, potentially inflating that number relative to the schools in single school catchments, so bear that in mind, however it can still be viewed as a crude measure of demand. I will disaggregate 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices (well, just 1st choice, actually) in some other graphs below.\nAll schools within multi-school catchments are very popular and are able to easily fill their offer numbers and probably could at least twice over - which is useful context when considering PAN reductions.\nSome schools in Brighton received low numbers of applications. For BACA and Longhill, the numbers of applications they received were BELOW their PANs. These were not popular schools in 2024.\nFor BACA and Longhill, their total offer numbers were also below their PANs. This means the schools were very under-subscribed and had excess capacity. Longhill had a PAN of 270 and a total offer count of 94. Almost three times fewer students attending than there were places available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Relative School Popularity (School 2024 Application to 2024 PAN ratio divided by Average 2024 Brighton Application to PAN ratio)\nAnother way of looking at Applications vs PANs is to take the ratio of applications to PAN and compare this with the city average - this is a form of standarisation to allow more meaningful comparison where underlying number vary. In the graph in Figure 3 above, the data has been rescaled (code in the github link) so that anything > 0 is greater popularity relative to other schools in the city, and anything < 0 is less popular.\nInterestingly, we can see that Kings School - the smallest in the city in terms of places available with a PAN of 165, is relatively the most popular, Longhill, on the other hand, is relatively the least popular even after scaling according to the city average. Remember this for later on."

More rejections occur where first preferences are high.\nThree schools - Varndean, King’s and Cardinal Newman had more first-preference than PANs, indicating very high demand.\nBACA, PACA and Longhill have significantly more PANs than first preference and thus larger proportions of their cohorts are filled with students who did not choose them as a first choice, indicating low demand."

In fact, for the most popular schools, their first-preference applications are far in excess of the places they have been allocated by the council - their PANS could easily be much higher, relative to other schools in the City.\nSome schools have PANs far in excess of their popularity which affects the rest of the system negatively. PANs matter when you have more demand than places as you can’t go any higher. When you have less demand than places in one school, the PAN is entirely irrelevant for the school (if you’ve only given out 94 offers, it doesn’t matter if your PAN is 270 or 2700!) but HUGELY relevant for the rest of the schools in the system as the number of pupils they can take in is reduced."

These new boundaries are slightly different and will have slightly different pupil numbers within catchments, but they are similar enough to the present catchment to hopefully still be able to make reasonable comparison. If more and better data arrive in the future, I will of course re-visit and update.\n\nThe graph above is a representation of the data provided in slide 11 of the materials supplied by the council. Under “Option A”, it’s clear to see that the council proposes to reduce PANS for all Council run schools in the city at two points in the future, first in 2026 (which they are also proposing to coincide with a boundary change - I will not cover boundary changes in this piece, but will do something on boundaries and geography in the future) and then again in 2030 (unclear if boundary changes are also on the cards at this point).\nBelow we see the same data, but this time in a table with the Council City-Wide PAN targets they have set at the bottom. Next to these council PAN targets are three illustrative scenarios I have produced to explore the decisions the council is making and shine a light the political choices (for this is not a neutral process, far from it!) they are making through their PAN setting. The final column is a Scenario I am calling the “Kings 2026 PAN Scenario” and I believe is the scenario which could be the key to unlocking the challenges the city is currently facing. I will explain why this is below.\n\nTable 1 - 2024 PAN and Various PAN scenarios\n\n\n\nCouncil PAN and PAN Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\nType\nPAN 2024\nPAN 2026\nPAN 2030\nPAN 2026 Scaled Popularity\nPAN 2026 Scaled Even\nPAN 2026 Kings Scenario\n\n\n\n\nBlatchington Mill School\nCommunity school\n330\n270\n240\n289\n315\n330\n\n\nBrighton Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n180\n180\n180\n57\n172\n165\n\n\nCardinal Newman Catholic School\nVoluntary aided school\n360\n360\n360\n388\n343\n360\n\n\nDorothy Stringer School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n270\n380\n315\n330\n\n\nHove Park School and Sixth Form Centre\nCommunity school\n180\n180\n180\n250\n172\n180\n\n\nKing’s School\nFree schools\n165\n165\n165\n275\n157\n165\n\n\nLonghill High School\nCommunity school\n270\n240\n180\n55\n257\n165\n\n\nPatcham High School\nCommunity school\n225\n225\n180\n228\n214\n225\n\n\nPortslade Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n220\n220\n220\n128\n210\n220\n\n\nVarndean School\nCommunity school\n300\n270\n240\n393\n286\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n2560\n2410\n2215\n2443\n2441\n2440\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations - Council Proposed PANs\n\nI have made a number of earlier observations which look at proposed PAN reductions for different schools in the city level relative to the population distribution of pupils and have shown that there are more severe reductions in areas of higher demand and less severe reductions in areas of lower demand, so I won’t go over that again here.\nWhat I will comment on here, however, are the PAN levels relative concepts of popularity, equality and equity - a different, but vitally important angle.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 1 - Scaled by Popularity\n\nFirstly, I should point out that these scenarios below are illustrative - I know that school entry numbers are predicated on multiples of 30, but these are designed to show the effect of different policies and priorities on these numbers.\nTaking relative popularity as shown in Figure 3 above, and using that to scale up and down the PAN according the level of popularity in 2024, we see:\n\nThe PANs for Dorothy Stringer, Varndean, Hove Park, Kings, and Varndean in 2026 would all increase by quite large numbers of pupils, reflecting their popularity and accommodating demand.\nThe PANs for Blatchington Mill would reduce almost in line with proposals, Cardinal newman, already with a high PAN, would remain similar, and Patcham would remain virtually the same.\nThe PANs for BACA, PACA and Longhill would decline considerably and to the point where they would not be viable schools.\n\nAs stated at the top, this is merely illustrative and NOT in any form a recommendation, but it is useful to explore how the reality of school popularity would change the PANs across the city if it were used.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 2 - Scaled by even (equal) reductions\n\nWhat would happen if the council reduced PANs down for each school, but did so evenly across the whole city, according to their current distributions? i.e. dividing each school PAN 2004 by the total Brighton PAN in 2024 and simply multiplying that proportion by the 2026 Brighton Total PAN. Again, I know these don’t fit into multiples of 30, but help for illustration.\nWhat this scenario is useful for is exploring is the impact of some schools being able to opt out of reducing thir PANs. If all things were equal, the 2026 Scaled Even PAN would be the same as the Council 2026 PAN.\nAs we can see, things are not equal. Part of this, of course, it due to the fact mentioned earlier that BACA, PACA, Cardinal Newman and Kings set their own PANs at the moment and the Council can’t change this.\nHowever, we can start to see which schools are hit harder by the intractability of not being able to make the non-council run schools take their fair share of the hit.\n\nBlatchington Mill’s PAN is 15 pupils lower than expected\nLonghill is 17 students lower than expected\nDorothy Stringer 15 students lower\nVarndean at 15/16 students lower.\n\nThe presence of schools in the system that can set their own PANs, unfairly disadvantages other schools who can’t in this scenario.\nWe can see that more-or-less what the council are proposing - factoring out the schools they can’t control - is something close to this equal reduction scenario, with Patcham perhaps being a little more equal than the others. However, equality is quite different from equity, which pays attention to different levels of need.\nAnother important point to note is that there is a very large difference between a PAN set according to popularity and a pan set according to equality. While we wouldn’t want to just consider current popularity for various reasons (popularity ebs and flows, it reduces diversity, crowds out those who are different etc.) equally, setting PANs equally fails to acknowledge there there are any reasonable justifications for some variation in the system.\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - the Kings Scenario\n\nThis scenario takes a little explaining which I will do below. One way of thinking about this scenario is it is the EQUITY scenario. It pays more attention to equality but also pays some attention to need as defined by demand for places. It is designed to offer an alternative to focusing just on popularity or equality. The outcomes of this scenario are:\n\nMost schools in the city don’t need to alter their 2026 PANs from current levels at all.\nNo school in the City has a PAN lower than the demonstrably viable 165 PAN that Kings School already has (hence the scenario name).\nPANs are more closely aligned with demand, although a number of schools are ‘donating to the system’ - doing their bit for the good of the whole school system in the city by having PANs considerably lower than their demand levels would suggest, allowing less popular schools to retain viability.\n\n\nBelow, some more context to this problem:\n\nSmall School Viability - the BACA and Longhill challenge\nIn the Town Hall face-to-face meeting and again in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024 on Tuesday, Cllr Taylor stated two relevant things:\n\nThe Labour Council campaigned on a manifesto that promised that it would not close a school within Brighton and Hove.\nThat it was his view that a year 7 PAN of lower than 180 would not lead to a viable school that could remain open.\n\nThe latter is tied intrinsically to the former with these two statements, but is this really the case? Let’s unpick this a little and zoom in on the second of the statements.\n\n\nSmall Schools in England and Wales\nThe Government provides data on all schools in England and Wales through their edubase dataset, published annually. https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/ - the database is in the data folder which will allow you to recreate all of this analysis at home with the github code links above.\nIn order that we are comparing like-with-like, let’s only look at open state-funded 11-16 schools in England and Wales. The histogram below shows the distribution of the number of pupils in these schools. The red and cyan lines show the number of pupils at Longhill and PACA respectively (included in the histogram distribution).\nI have not included BACA or Kings in the histogram as they are 11-19 schools and thus not directly comparable, however I have included their numbers as indicative vertical lines on the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Histogram showing the distribution, by total numbers of pupils recorded in the school in 2024, of all open, 11-16 state funded secondary schools in England and Wales.\n\nWhat we can see from the histogram in Figure 6 is that despite the lowest pupil numbers in the city, Longhill and BACA are not outlier schools nationally. Indeed quite the opposite, they fall somewhere near the middle of the distribution of all comparable schools, perhaps slightly on the left of the distribution, so below average, but most people observing the graph would agree that they are pretty average sized schools.\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nTotal size, is of course, somewhat different to PAN, but for a school with 5 year-groups (Yr 7 to Yr 11) and equal numbers of pupils in each year (which would be the case for popular schools that hit their PAN every year), if the PAN was set at 165 (the same as Kings in 2024) the total school population would be 825. Longhill currently has a population of - checks figures - 825.\nThe national distribution of comparable schools shows that the small schools in Brighton are not ‘small schools’ just small relative to the city.\nIt is abundantly clear from the evidence above that schools even smaller than the smallest in Brighton are viable. Even if the PANs in the small schools dropped lower than I am recommending currently (165) to, say, a 4-form entry of 150 (a reasonable scenario) - this would equate to a school size of 750 pupils or the pink vertical line on this histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the argument for closing schools in Brighton and Hove with low numbers stack up?\nTo reiterate, the council has repeated cited at the in person consultation meeting I attended and again in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024 that it is not sustainable to have schools with low numbers of pupils. In the Scrutiny meeting, Councillor Helliwell asked a question about the minimum viability of schools.\nCouncillor Taylor and Richard Barker responded that is was their view that 180 pupils was the minimum single year PAN they would consider viable.\nGiven the evidence above, it would appear that they are mistaken in this view. This is absolutely crucial as, as I will show below, it is the case that it is approprate, fair and equitable to reduce the PAN of at least one school in the city to a level very slightly below 180 (and still well above their intake for the last 5 years) for the benefit of all schools in the city. Futhermore, the evidence above proves:\n\nA large number of comparable 11-16 schools in England and Wales (495 if you count them) are operating with smaller numbers of students than Longhill and BACA.\nWithin Brighton itself, the Kings School, a thriving and demonstrably viable school in the North of the city, is doing very well with a PAN of 165.\nEven if Longhill and BACA reduced their PANs to a 4-form entry of 150 - something I am not advocating for here - they would still not be uncommonly small in England and Wales terms. So there is a lot of room for manoeuvre if only the council could think creatively.\n\nNow, of course, there are financial intricacies and challenges to which I am not privy and potentially other considerations, but a question we would all be forgiven for asking at this point is:\n\nIs there a particular skills deficit within Brighton and Hove Council that it considers itself unable to contemplate running schools in the city of a size that a large proportion of other local authorities in the country appear to manage quite happily?\nWhy does the council consider itself unable to manage what other councils are able to achieve?\nWould a sensible course of action be to consult with other local authorities who are more experienced in dealing with some smaller schools in their portfolio?\nIf there are good arguments against this, what are they, and what evidence can you provide to support those arguments?\n\n\n\n\nPAN 2026 Scenario 3 - Continued\nIt is clear then, that there is no justifiable reason why Brighton and Hove Council can’t run some schools with PANs lower than 180. I have shown how PANs of even 150 are viable in a national context.\nRecap\n\nWe know that if PANs bore any relation to demand (PAN 2026 scaled by popularity, below), schools like Longhill, BACA and PACA would not be viable in 2026.\nWe know that if we just reduce PANs evenly across the system in 2026, popular and in-demand schools will be turning away pupils they could easily accommodate (and we’ve not even got the the impacts of the new FSM policy and the exodus of pupils from the Private sector after the introduction of VAT)\n\n\nBack to the PANs and Demand\n\n# Create kable table\nkable(admissions_with_sum, caption = \"Council PAN and PAN Scenarios\")\n\n\nCouncil PAN and PAN Scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool\nType\nPAN 2024\nPAN 2026\nPAN 2030\nPAN 2026 Scaled Popularity\nPAN 2026 Scaled Even\nPAN 2026 Kings Scenario\n\n\n\n\nBlatchington Mill School\nCommunity school\n330\n270\n240\n289\n315\n330\n\n\nBrighton Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n180\n180\n180\n57\n172\n165\n\n\nCardinal Newman Catholic School\nVoluntary aided school\n360\n360\n360\n388\n343\n360\n\n\nDorothy Stringer School\nCommunity school\n330\n300\n270\n380\n315\n330\n\n\nHove Park School and Sixth Form Centre\nCommunity school\n180\n180\n180\n250\n172\n180\n\n\nKing’s School\nFree schools\n165\n165\n165\n275\n157\n165\n\n\nLonghill High School\nCommunity school\n270\n240\n180\n55\n257\n165\n\n\nPatcham High School\nCommunity school\n225\n225\n180\n228\n214\n225\n\n\nPortslade Aldridge Community Academy\nAcademy sponsor led\n220\n220\n220\n128\n210\n220\n\n\nVarndean School\nCommunity school\n300\n270\n240\n393\n286\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n2560\n2410\n2215\n2443\n2441\n2440\n\n\n\n\n\nA more equitable solution to the PAN problem that pays due consideration to demand, while also acknowledging the reality of pupil numbers for all schools across this city, can be represented by my PAN 2026 Kings Scenario above.\nIn this scenario:\n\nMost schools in the city keep PANs that are in line with their 2024 levels. Many of these schools could accommodate more, but in the interests of continuing the viability of other schools in the system, they are in effect donating PAN to less popular schools.\nThe recommendation is that BACA in an ideal world would reduce its PAN to 165 - well in excess of a demand-based PAN, but lower than its current level. I acknowledge that under the current system this is not possible, but at just 15 students options probably exist to transfer un-used PAN to larger schools as has been done with Varndean in the last, bear with me - we’re within margins of error in the whole system now.\nEvery other school in Brighton EXCEPT Longhill, keeps its PANs at the 2024 Level. For most of these schools, as I have said, this is a reduction in PAN relative to popularity. I propose Longhill reduces its PAN to 165 - the same level as Kings School - and still WELL IN EXCESS of its actual student intake in 2024 of 94 students - and as we will see later, well in excess of its actual student number for the LAST 5 YEARS.\n\nI believe this proposal is both workable, sensible and importantly, equitable, recognising both the need to keep all schools open in the city and the recognition of demand in other places. It will also buy the council the time it needs, should it wish to try other equity improving initiatives around diversity and segregation to fully engage in a more comprehensive review of all evidence from all of the inter-connected domains, while hitting its own overall PAN targets if that is an operational challenge. Essentially, while not everybody wins, there is a much lower proportion of losers under this strategy.\nI am aware - and indeed steeling myself for the inevitable - that some may feel that despite all of the evidence above, I am somehow picking on Longhill, but to be totally honest, I don’t think my brain had even acknowledged its existence until this week - yes, I knew there was a school in Rottingdean/Ovingdean, but that was all I knew - I didn’t know any of its background. But its importance has started to shine through incredibly brightly while carrying out data analysis on the topic over the last week or so. So let’s explore the Longhill problem in a little more detail."

    "text": "The Longhill Challenge\n\nRecent Numbers\n\nLonghill is a school on the Eastern geographic edge of the city in Rottingdean (for a map see my last analysis here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html#current-situation)\nThe intakes of all secondary schools in the city are a matter of public record and can be obtained from the Council’s webpages, for example - https://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/allocation-factsheet-year-7-places-september-2024\nYou can see that in 2024, Longhill admitted (or at least offered places to) 94 students. This was relative to a PAN in 2024 of 270 places. Put another way, the school admitted almost three-times fewer students than its PAN would have allowed it to.\nClearly this is not ideal for Longhill as the funding that schools get is tied to pupil numbers (if you are interested in exactly how this works - HT James for this - see here). But what does it mean for the rest of the school system in Brighton, is this good or bad news?\nIt’s bad. In 2024, Brighton Council set a hard ceiling of 2560 for its PAN - schools are legally not allowed to admit more pupils than their PAN (although Varndean did due to special circumstances). If one school in the system has a much higher PAN than it can reasonably be expected to hit, the net effect is it takes potential capacity away from other schools. It’s a classic example of a zero-sum game.\nAs I mentioned earlier in this piece, PANs are originally derived from a physical measure of school size - the volume of the buildings, pretty much. So it might be the case that they are maxed out in terms of their physical limits - so not quite a zero-sum game in this context.\nIn 2024 it could be argued that Longhill isn’t leeching capacity from other schools if other schools are already maxed out (and in 2024 I think most in the city were), but this picture changes in a declining school roll environment.\nUnder current Council proposals for 2026 in Option A, Longhill’s PAN reduces slightly to 240, but is it reasonable to expect anything like this number of students to attend? If it is not, and other schools in the system already in high demand are being forced to reduce their PANs as well, then we are now in a situation where Longhill is unfairly taking capacity away from schools where demand is higher.\n\n\n\nWhy are Longhill’s 2024 numbers low - is this an anomaly and might we expect them to change?\n\nPeople might reasonably ask, what if 2024 is just an out-of-character blip? Something related to its recent downgrading from an Ofsted rating of “Good” in 2018? to “Requires Improvement” in 2024?\nOr what if it is just a brief demographic anomaly? I heard someone say in the consultation meeting “Longhill used to be the best school in the city!” - If its numbers were boosted, would it not just return to its former glory?\nTo try and answer these questions, we need to dig back into history a little. What were it’s numbers like in previous years?\n\nAs an aside, this is a plea again to Brighton Council - please sort your data out!! I had to trawl through about 11 different web-pages, open several different PDF documents *NB, PDFs are a TERRIBLE way to store data - webpages not much better. Spreadsheets, csv files, or, whisper it - an API - would all be better. If it weren’t for my tame AI helper, I’d still be processing these data next month!\nAll of my code for processing these data and the original source files can be accessed here - https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/data_processing_scripts.html\n\n\nSchool Application and Offer History Across Brighton\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Total Applications to all schools in the City, 2014-2024\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Total Offers to Pupils by School, 2014-2024\nFigures 7 and 8 above show the published total application and offer data by school for the city between 2014-2024 - a few points to note\n\nYou will notice that over the 11-year period, BACA is persistently at the bottom of the rankings on both measures and in recent years has been joined by Longhill\nVarndean, Dorothy Stringer and Cardinal Newman are fairly consistently near the top on both measures.\n\nPatterns can be a little difficult to discern with all schools on the graph, so lets extract our smallest schools in the city:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Total Applications (small schools), 2014-2024 - with linear trend lines fitted.\n\nInterpretation\nWhat Figures 9 and 10 above show more clearly are the 11-year linear trends associated with applications to the smallest schools in the city. These have some properties of note:\n\nWhile in terms of both applications and offers, there is a degree of bouncing around in the numbers, the linear trends are revealing.\nFor Longhill, the trend in both applications and offers is of secular decline.\nLonghill was rated as “Good” by Ofsted in 2018 which is likely to account for the sudden up-tick in applications and offers in 2019. However, it remained “Good” (at least as far as the official ofsted reports were concerned) until March 2024 - a 6-year period of being “Good” that also saw a year-on-year decline in both applications and offers.\nSimilarly, prior to 2018, Longhill also had a period of “required improvement” when both its applications and admissions were trending higher.\nBoth of these observations are evidence that it is not just the quality of the education on offer which might be resulting in the decline (in student number terms) of the school. It is likely (and I will explore this in the future) that these are longer-term demographic trends in the city, combined with the physically remote location of the school.\nOne analogy of the Council’s current approach to Longhill could be that it is taking on the role of King Canute trying to hold back the inevitable demographic tide - a battle that it will not win as these things are long-term, slow-dynamic systems.\nIt should be noted that the Council can do nothing about the location of the school - powerful as it might be, even it cannot move mountains or indeed rolling chalk hills! There’s little it can do about demography either - ageing, migration, fertility and mortality are largely out of its control. I can build new housing, and this could be something that might help arrest the decline of the school a little, but this is also a project outside of the remit of the education team.\nPerhaps most noticeable about Longhill’s decline is that since 2020, it’s applications have been in a slow, steady and regular decline. This suggests to me the trend is here to stay and very much supports my contention that a PAN of 270 is far too high both now and in the near and long-term future.\nTo be fair to the Council, the appear to have noticed some of this themselves and in 2030 have proposed under Option A, to reduce Longhill’s PAN to 180, but from the evidence I have presented here, I think this is too late. The PAN needs to be reduced more dramatically and sooner.\nWhile Longhill’s PAN remains artificially high - and FAR higher than it’s likely student numbers even under the most optimistic of future scenarios, in a city system of overall declining student numbers and where most of these numbers are actually Longhill’s to lose, the net effect is that Longhill is artifically forcing other schools in the system to lower their numbers when they don’t need to.\nJust to note again, if you are coming in with numbers lower than your PAN, the PAN is utterly meaningless for you as an institution, but potentially catastrophic for other schools in the system who are forced to cut classes when they don’t need to. A more accurate PAN means the rest of the PANs can be spread around more equitably. It is an utter no-brainer to reduce Longhill’s PAN, it will not make their situation any worse than it currently is, but stands to improve the situation for all other schools in the city.\nWe can contrast Longhill’s decline with the rapid ascent of the Kings School. Almost in a mirror of the fortunes of Longhill, Kings School has been on the up. Despite its hard ceiling of a PAN of 165, which you can see coming in to play in 2018 in Figure 10.\nKings School could actually go higher, but it is physically located in an area of the city congested with schools, so I would not advocate for this - where it is on PAN would appear to be sensible.\nA word about BACA - BACA’s numbers are low, but relative to the other small schools in the city, fairly steady. I would view this as encouraging and BACA should be supported to be the important small school serving an important part of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Yearly application trends at four of the larger / more popular schools in the city\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12 - Yearly offer trends at four of the larger / more popular schools in the city\n\nBy way of contrast, Figures 11 and 12 show the temporal trends for applications and admissions in some of the more popular schools in the city.\nWhat is noticeable about these schools is their relative consistency. There is some variation and some trending slightly up or slightly down - this will be relevant later when we compare to long-term population trends at the city level, but at the moment we can note that any PAN changes imposed on these schools would run counter to their long-term trends of popularity and viability and I would view it as a negative intervention on the part of the council.\n\n\n\n\nThe Longhill Challenge - Conclusions and Recommendations\nI hope that the evidence of longer-term trends presented here helps evidence that Longhill is not being unfairly targeted in this analysis. It has long-term issues of declining number which do not appear to be directly related over the long term to its performance - of course more work would need to be done to establish precisely the contributions of demography and performance to this observation.\nI am aware that what I have presented here will not solve the problems at Longhill - the council will have to think long and hard about a strategy of managed decline in numbers that can still support the school to remain viable.\nIt’s also true that Longhill’s student population problems might get even worse under the new scheme to allow FSM students (40% of the Longhill population!) to select schools in other parts of the city should they wish. These students will go off and mix in more affluent parts of the city and improve segregation and integration - something that the Council’s other expert, Professor Stephen Gorard presented as having universally positive outcomes in the People Overview and Scrutiny Committee held on 9/10/2024. However, the solution to this problem is not to bus students long-distances back the other way. Indeed Prof Gorard also said very clearly that ’any programmes of mixing and integration would need careful thought so as to cause MINIMUM DISRUPTION.\nI have evidenced above that Longhill can be viable as a smaller school and I think it should be supported to be a thriving smaller school, but it is not viable as a large school, no matter what ill-conceived policy might be imposed to force it to be one. Anything like this would run against a huge weight of evidence and will be ultimately destined to fail, generating more problems than it solves in the process.\nOne final point of note is that the council needs to come to terms with the reality that Longhill is already a very different school in size and demography than it was perhaps in the time when Cllr Taylor was a student. Yes, it still occupies the same site, but the site does not suit the school it is any more.\nThis is actually a fantastic opportunity should the council choose to grasp it. It owns a large site in an affluent part of the city that should it choose to reduce the size of the estate, then it could use this resource for any number of productive initiatives, not limited to but perhaps including affordable housing (although I am aware of the challenges the planning system may through up here). This is an opportunity that needs the kind of thinking beyond narrow educational boundaries I have already discussed.\nI would urge the council to consider this very carefully indeed. I will re-iterate this:\nLonghill does NOT need to close but it must be helped to manage its long-term structural decline in pupil numbers over the coming years. This problem will not be solved by bussing students in from other parts of the city, the problem is too big and too systemic for this to be a viable fix, but a smaller school may actually present opportunities for the council it has not yet considered."

    "text": "How do the Council come up with total PANs for the city anyway? And are these numbers reliable?\nGood question - I’m glad you asked! I promise this is one final push, stick with me!\nIn my last piece I implored the Council to publish as much information as possible, including their methodology for estimating (present day) and projecting (into the future) pupil populations in the city. I will ask again - PLEASE PUBLISH YOUR DATA AND METHODOLOGY.\nYear 7 PANs relate directly to the Population of children who will be going into Year 7 in the next school year. For most children when they start, they will be 11 years old. So how do we know how many there are?\nI know a little bit about population estimation and projection - in the dim and distant past (while we were still in Europe - remember those days?!) - I worked on an EU Funded project to project populations in different parts of the European Union, called DEMIFER - here is some work we did on London, if you are interested - https://archive.espon.eu/sites/default/files/attachments/DEMIFER_Deliverable12_12_UKI1_UKI2Inner_and_Outer_London.pdf\nAnyway as my mentor at the time Professor Phil Rees used to say - “All projections are wrong, but some are more wrong than others!” - sage words that have stuck with me ever since.\nIn the face-to-face council meeting many people attended on Tuesday, someone asked about the validity of the numbers and the response was “our projections are reliable” or something to that effect. I could almost hear Phil Rees fall off his chair in Leeds!\nSo how do I think these numbers are arrived at and do I believe them? In the absence of a published methodology we will have to guess. If I were the council this is how I would do it:\n\nProbably my most reliable source of data is the information I already know about how many children I have in year 6 in the state school sector - i.e. within the council run primary schools in the city. This is a pretty good start. Depending on when in the year I count those year 6 children before they start year 7 things might change - a greater or lesser number may move away, some may arrive either from within the country or from abroad. Sadly some might die. Some might already be in the city, perhaps at a private prep school, but their parents decide the state sectors is a better (or cheaper) option at secondary school. Some may go the opposite way from a state primary into the private sector. More or less though, most children in year 6 in the state sector will more into year 7 in the state sector and adding all of these up will give a pretty decent estimate of the total PAN in the city.\n\nWhat I have described above is at the high City level - The council have a further advantage of knowing WHERE in the city these primary school children live. They know which catchments they live in, so they have a pretty good idea which secondary schools they are most likely to apply to.\nIt would be brilliant if the council were able to release at the neighbourhood level, counts of year 6 (10 year old) pupils across the city into the public domain. This is useful as we can then compare these data with other datasets such as the Census which can be used as both cross-validation but also allow us to estimate how many non-state-school children of the same age are in different areas. This is important as, as we shall see, occasionally there are shocks to the system which can throw our estimates out a bit.\n\nNormally, we would expect our attempts at projecting populations into the future to get worse, the further away from the last reliable point of real data. This is why all Office for National Statistics (ONS) Projections are re-based (corrected) every time there is a census.\nMost projections start life with the Census. In the UK, the last Census was in 2021 (you can probably remember filling it out as there wasn’t much else to do during the Pandemic!) and only happens every 10 years.\nTo try and fill the void between Censuses, various different sources of population data can feed in to try and account for things like internal migration, international migration births, deaths, refugees, asylum seekers, and visitors who switch to stayers. One of the most commonly used sources are GP patient registers and these are pretty good for some types of people (kids, old people, women) but pretty bad for young men (who often are slow to register with a GP once they move).\nTo help with its PAN projections, on p255 of the report on this page - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/mgChooseDocPack.aspx?ID=11316 - it’s clear that the council uses the Schools Census and GP register data, with some adjustments applied for children attending the two Religious Schools (although not private Schools) in the city."

    "text": "Comparing Brighton PAN Projections with ONS Sub-National Population Projections\nVerifying the validity of the Population Projections and associated PAN projections produced by the Council is important. If projections are out, this could have existential impacts on schools, so getting it right is important. Further context to this concern is given in 2015 where a review of Brighton’s pupil projection methodology was carried out - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?AIId=47946 - and found issues with the methodology employed. While I am sure the council has acted upon the recommendations of the report, I can find no detailed documentation describing how their current projections are calculated.\nWhile I have no reason to believe the Council employs a poor methodology to project its city-level and catchment-specific student populations and PAN, without documentation and methodology to support the numbers, we don’t really know. Verification is a basic part of due diligence, especially if disruptive changes hinge on the numbers produced.\nIt should be noted that given the importance of accurate projections for a range of applications, from estimating school numbers to projecting elderly care need, a number of Local Authorities in the UK turn to established professionals for assistance. Companies like Edge Analytics in Leeds provide these services - a legitimate question to ask is whether the reason for Brighton not producing methodology documentation is because they buy in professional services, and if so, from whom?\nIn the UK, the most reliable population projection data available are the ONS Sub-National Population Projections - SNPP. As national statistics, these are the benchmark, so any projections that deviate, not necessarily in absolute terms, but certainly in relative terms, need careful justification and evidencing.\nIn Brighton, tucked away on p255 of another (!!!) PDF document - https://democracy.brighton-hove.gov.uk/mgChooseDocPack.aspx?ID=11316 - can be found the official (as of 22nd January 2024) Pupil Population Projection Numbers. I have been able to compare them with the ONS projections for 11 year olds below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Comparison of Brighton PAN projections and ONS Sub-National Population Projections.\nThere are, as ever, a few things to note here:\n\nFirstly the ONS SNPP numbers are higher - this is to be expected as the Brighton numbers should be adjusted down to only account for pupils in the state sector - home schooled pupils and private school pupils are likely the main reason for discrepancies but others probably exist.\nOne small point is these numbers from the published Brighton documentation from Jan 2024 are different from the numbers that appear in the consultation PowerPoint. Projections do change, but without a published methodology, the reasons behind this are opaque.\nIn 2024 the difference is 659 people aged 11 across the city - quite a large number if we think about this in terms of class sizes of 30 and the PANs for individual schools seen earlier. This difference grows and contracts a little until 2030 when it is at 563, but then gets much larger to 878 by 2034.\nWhat this trend shows - and you can see it in the graph - is that Brighton and Hove Council are projecting numbers of school children in the city to decline FASTER and more severely than the Official ONS National Statistics.\nPut another way, if we apply the ONS annual population change rate to the Brighton starting PAN in 2024, we end up with quite different population estimates - see Figure 14 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Population Projects with Brighton PAN tracking ONS annual rate\n\nWe can see that by applying the ONS rate - a legitimate and defensible methology, we can actually end up with plausible, but quite different population estimates.\nUnder this methodology, in 2026 we have a PAN of 2347 (vs original Brighton PAN of 2270 - i.e. we have gained 77 students, magically. Roll forward to 2030 - the next big PAN reduction point, and we have 127 more students.\n\nMy point here, is not to say that applying the ONS rate to the Brighton population is better - it is almost certainly an inferior methodology (although, who knows, it might not be!) My point is to say - without the full methodology published by the council, they might as well be plucking the numbers out of thin air!\nMy hasty estimates above are totally plausible. They apply a method which is common the world over in projections, but they arrive very different numbers at crucial years which could mean the difference between schools losing entire classes from their entry cohorts, or having a sound argument for increasing capacity.\n\nIndependent Schools\nOn final note on this topic needs to go to the role that Private/Independent Schools play in the Brighton System.\nIt is difficult to determine how many Brighton resident children attend independent schools within the city, but it will be a measured in the hundreds judging by the differences the the PAN and the ONS 11 year old estimates above.\nThe Labour Party (the National one) are planning to introduce VAT on Private School fees - https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/08/vat-private-school-fees-no-delay-says-minister - no-one knows that the impact of this will in terms of adding more students who parents can no longer afford the costs, into the state system, but it will be non-zero.\nThis of course, would result in more students in the state school system and correspondingly any city-wide PAN projections needing to be uplifted."

    "section": "",
    "text": "*Note, I have made a few adjustments below to the original piece - adjusting for both Higher Tier Local Authorities. I have also included an additional section on the Education Policy Institute’s Work, especially related to their methodology in their Annual Report - https://epi.org.uk/annual-report-2024-foreword-executive-summary/ and why it should be given more weight than the raw DfE data - I have also, for completeness, provided graphs for Percentage of pupils achieving grades 9-4 or above in English and mathematics GCSEs - (in addition to 9-5).\nFirst of all, I’d like to say that I’m very grateful the Cllr Taylor and his team have been reading my analysis so carefully.\nYesterday I received an email from Jacob alerting me that he’d discovered an issue and was concerned that some of the messages from parents he’d been receiving were using incorrect facts. In particular, in relation the attainment gap I reported in this section of my last piece.\nHaving looked at the point he raised and having carried out some new analysis with the data that the council had originally used to produce the graph below, I’m happy to report that almost all of observations I originally made still stand - and indeed are strengthened further by the new analysis, so I would like to thank them for that.\nI would like to state that while I am very grateful for the link to some actual, real, verifiable data, it’s disappointing that the first time the council were able to provide this was two days AFTER the end of the engagement exercise. This goes back to my original point in my very first piece of work - that the council need be more transparent and up-front with the data they use to make decisions and indeed charge their rhetoric. I’m glad that they have now provided this data, but it would have been much more useful to have had it at the start of the process.\nOne observation on the attainment gap has changed in the light of this new analysis - the gap in Brighton is larger relative to the rest of the country than originally estimated from the Council’s original graph (which I assume will now be corrected). However the new data has allowed us to explore why this is. We can now see very clearly that both disadvantaged pupils AND non-disadvantaged pupils perform ABOVE the national average (median) in England (even including London).\nI’ll repeat that - In Brighton both disadvantaged pupils AND non-disadvantaged pupils perform ABOVE the national average (median) for GCSE grades 5-9 Attainment in Maths and English. Above.\nThe gap is because the non-disadvantaged pupils perform even better than average - meaning the gap is larger relative to other places with similar achievement for disadvantaged pupils.\nHere is the original graph from the council:\n\nNow the graph that Cllr Taylor was concerned about in my last analysis was this one:\n\nNow, the issue Cllr Taylor alerted me to relates to the two green dots at the top of this chart.\nHere’s the point he raised: “You have compared Disadvantaged Attainment to All Pupil attainment, which is not how the Attainment Gap is calculated. Disadvantaged attainment has to be compared to Non-Disadvantaged Attainment (not all pupils).”\nA good point - and a correct one. An even better point had it have been raised when he put his own slides together, as you can see that this is exactly what the bar chart at the top is showing! I used their data. In drawing these green dots and time was short and data was sparse, I took the figures from the Council graph.\nBut mistakes happen - the rest of my graph above (below the green dot) was actually using FSM regional data - not ideal, but the best I could lay my hands on at the time without a link to the original data. As I note above, Cllr Taylor was kind enough to send me the link to the original data, and after a bit of digging around I found the correct file and have been able to correct the analysis.\n\n\nWell, short answer is, no. We are no more stained than we were before. And much of the stain (the attainment gap in Brighton being worse than the attainment gap nationally) is actually an artefact of the council using the wrong ‘average’ - as I will explain below. Had they used the correct average - the median - a different picture emerges.\nThere still appears to be some confusion online, which hopefully this bit of analysis will clear up once and for all.\n\nCllr Taylor - “Non-Disadvantaged attainment in Brighton and Hove was 57.5 in 2022-23, giving us an attainment gap of 33.5.” - looking at the data, this observation is true.\nCllr Taylor on Facebook - “Indeed - when compared to individual local authorities, our city has the 16th highest attainment gap of 152 local authorities - nearly in the top decile.” This observation is true, when looking at just one of the possible attainment gap variables, - the Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in English and Mathematics GCSEs - however as is pointed out by the Educational Policy Institute in their annual report - the average GCSE score across English and Maths in England, was 4.6. So in using this variable is effectively representing the - above-average attainment gap. However this is the ‘raw’ gap (i.e. a gap of 10-20% pass rate is the same as a gap from 30-40% pass rate - same gap, very different story).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file I have used in the analysis below is called 2233_sl_lad_fsm_dis_data_revised.csv (downloaded from here) – I am now almost certain that the data in Cllr Taylor’s original graph comes from the field “pt_l2basics_95” - Percentage of pupils achieving grades 5 or above in English and Mathematics GCSEs. Even more specifically, the 50% for Brighton comes from cell W266 in that file and the 24% for disadvantaged pupils comes from Cell W262 in the same sheet.\nI pre-filtered that file above (I know, I’d normally do it all in R but today I did filter in excel first - slaps-wrists - but I really wanted to eyeball the data first to make sure mistakes did not creep in). Those two files, derived from 2233_sl_lad_fsm_dis_data_revised.csv can be downloaded from here and here. (note in the underlying code, I have now adjusted to read the original file in and filter and aggregate on the fly). OK, so we’re all set.\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot that Brighton data. And even better than showing England and the South East, we can show all Local Authorities (upper and lower-tier now) in England. This gives us a much better way of comparing where Brighton sits relative to everywhere else. We can view this data below in a histogram:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Disadvantaged Pupils vs Total\n\nFirst thing to say is I am aware that this is still the “wrong” data - the disadvantaged pupils in this graph are also included in the Total - so double counted. I will correct this in the next graph, but it’s useful to have this here to see that it actually doesn’t make a huge amount of difference. Still, it’s worth doing things properly.\nThe second thing to note is The median values for disadvantaged pupils and advantaged pupils are shown by the solid lines, with the Brighton and Hove values in dashed lines.\n\nAs an important aside, I have used the median value as my measure of ‘average’ here - this is actually quite important and something the Council overlooked in their original bar-chart shown at the top where it appears they have used the artithmetic mean. Both are measures of central tendancy (mode being the other one that you might have heard of at school), but median is more appropriate where there there might be outliers (London, for example) and a a skewed distribution (more values at one end of the distribution as we can see in the disadvantaged historam above), and the reason why I have used it here. (There are various online guides as to when to use Median rather than mean, but most will probably start with wikipedia - this BBC Bitesize guide is also genuinely great - https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z99jpbk)\nRelatedly, much of the original “stain” that was identified was because the figure of 25.4% for England was the arithmetic mean for the country (according to the data - [40,074/157,963]*100). This is the average disadvantaged 9-5 Maths GCES Pass rate across all children in the county. However, if we took all of local pass rates for each local Authority - e.g. Brighton and Hove = 129/537 = 24% - and do the same for every other local authority, then median is the middle value in this set - and is 21.9%. Brighton is above average - as we already know by looking at the histogram above.\n\nThe third thing to note is this is a histogram. Not a bar chart. Each bar represents a count of local authorities that fall into the range of the x-axis value. It’s a nice way of seeing where Brighton sits relative to every other local authority in the country. If you look where Brighton is (on the blue side of the graph), it means there are another 22 local authorities (out of 298) whose total number of pupils achieving 9-5 grades in English and Maths is between 49-51%.\nAs the dotted lines for Brighton fall to the right of the solid vertical lines, it means that Brighton is above the median for 9-5 Maths and English GSCE grades for both disadvantaged and advantaged pupils. Advantaged pupils do achieve a bit higher above the average than disadvantaged pupils.\n\n\n\nBelow is a slightly different histogram created with slightly different rows of data from the same dataset. The disadvantaged data are exactly the same, but this time it is paired with data for non-disadvantaged pupils. If you add the two together, you get the total data from the previous graph. This is a better way of representing the data as it doesn’t double count the disadvantaged pupils.\n\n\nThere was a bit of a flurry of excitement on Facebook as originally in this piece I had used standard (“Lower Tier”) local authorities (as this is geography the data comes in). My lack of understanding was mocked as I should have known (as everyone surely does!) - that what matters for education policy is “Upper Tier” local authorities - sometimes known as Local Education Authorities. Ok fine, now is not the time to get into distributions of academies and free schools which are outside of the control of local authorities, let’s just see if upper tier makes any difference.\nI managed to source a lookup-table from the ONS so have been able to aggregate the original data up to the Upper Tier level for comparison. My data now exactly matches that used by Cllr Taylor, so we’re all good.\nAs it’s the same data, just a bit more aggregated, things haven’t changed much. We get some statistical smoothing going on (see my last piece for a bit of a guide on statistical smoothing) which shifts the medians a little - about 1% for the disadvantaged group, but nothing which changes the interpretation. See below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2a - Achievement, disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged, 153 “Upper Tier” Local Authorities (Local Education Authorities - LEAs)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2b - Achievement, disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged, 153 “Upper Tier” Local Authorities (Local Education Authorities - LEAs)\nNote - text below refers to the bottom of these two histograms - the original lower-tier data. When aggregating to ‘upper-tier’ the median for disadvantaged students is 22.97%. At lower tier, the median is 21.9% - so about 1% different. Brighton is the same size and shape in both tiers so remains at 24% - so either way, 1-2% above the national average.\nWhat’s changed? Well not very much (although I have used Brighton and Hove Albion colours in this one for fun - if they look a bit faded it’s because of the transparency!). The frequency distribution has changed on the right as the data are different, but:\n\nBrighton still does better than average for both its disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils.\nThe second important thing to note is the size of the gap between the solid line and the dotted line for disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils. It is smaller on the left than on the right. This is because the non-disadvantaged pupils are doing better than the disadvantaged pupils, relatively speaking. Although they are both performing above the national average.\nThe attainment gap is the gap between the two dotted lines and in this data, as Cllr Taylor correctly pointed out, it’s 33.5%.\n\nBut how does attainment and the gap compare with the rest country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above ranks every local authority in England by the performance of disadvantaged pupils, while also displaying, to the right, the relative performance of the non-disadvantaged pupils. Each pair of dots represents a single local authority.\nAnd it’s clear to see that Brighton is in the top half - as we would know from the histogram above.\nIt’s also clear that the relationship between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils is not the same across the country. In some places, the gap is much smaller, in others larger, but no discernible pattern between the two at this stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what about the gap? Given there is so much noise, it would make sense to try and standardise the gap by either disadvantaged or non-disadvantaged attainment. If we look at the gap relative to advantaged attainment – i.e. how do Disadvantaged students do relative to the performance of the advantaged students in the same local authority – a reasonable way of standardising - we get the plot above.\nWhat this shows is that in Brighton, the gap of 33.5% between disadvantaged (24%) and advantaged (57.5%) pupils is around 58% of that higher level of achievement in the city. Lower figures are better in this particular graph, so this gap is not in the top half of the English league table, but as the histogram above shows from the same data, this is because non-disadvantaged students are doing even better than the disadvantaged students, who are already doing better than average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne final plot adds a regional perspective - again, this is just disadvantaged pupils, but it’s clear to see here the effect of London on the data. Brighton is in the top half of the country, a very large number of local authorities at the top of the distribution are in London.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, I have also included the same analysis for the 4-9 grades in English and Maths. What you will notice is Brighton is still above average, but attainment of disadvantaged pupils is closer to the national average than for 9-5 grades. My overall observations about the gap do not change, however, it is worth asking the question why the attainment gap appears even better than this in the recent work carried out by the Education Policy Institute?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Education Policy Institute is an independent, impartial and evidence-based research institute that aims to promote high quality education outcomes for all children and young people, regardless of social background.” (from their website - https://epi.org.uk/our-mission-and-purpose/)\nEvery year they produce an annual report covering all aspects of educational inequalities in England and they are the gold-standard research organisation in this field.\nIn their most recent report, the gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils in Brighton and Hove at the secondary level compared to the rest of the country is considerably better than is suggested by the aggregate statistics published by the DfE - https://epi.org.uk/annual-report-2024-local-authority-gaps-2/\n\n\nIn the interactive (on their site - visit via the link above) map above, we can see that, in the bottom left, rather than ranking near the bottom of the league table for education gap as the raw DfE data suggests, the EPI rank Brighton in the top third of all LEAs in England. Furthermore, it is one of the few LEAs that have shown improvement - a decline in disadvantage - since 2019 (bottom right).\nSo what’s going on? Well, in their methodology section, they explain some differences in how they measure disadvantage. https://epi.org.uk/annual-report-2024-disadvantage-2/ - what they outline in their “How do we measure the disadvantage gap” box, they state that (through using the National Pupil Database (NPD) - which enables students to be tracked over time, rather than as a single-year snap-shot) they define disadvantage as any student who had received Free School Meals in the last 6-years. Therefore capturing a more comprehensive picture of disadvantage than a single year snapshot which might see some students go just over the very low threshold for free meals in one year.\nAnything else? Yes, they also then order pupils and attainment by their rank for disadvantage and non-disadvantage and compare these ranks with each other - a method known as the ‘mean rank difference’. This technique is useful where you have a skewed distribution of values - which we have here with London way out-performing other LAs and LEAs in the country.\nOne more thing - as they have longitudinal pupil data from the NPD, they are able to express the attainment gap in months of learning - an intuitive measure which shows, on average, how many months earlier non-disadvantaged students attained the same level, relative to the disadvantaged students. The 2024 annual report local authority profiles also show that between KS2 and KS4, Brighton and Hove moves up the rankings considerably, giving even more weight to the observation that its secondary schools are performing well.\nGiven that the EPI are THE experts in the field of educational inequalities, rather than making errors with central tendency or arguing over aggregations of local authorities, it might be more useful for the Council to defer to this evidence from the EPI if there were ever any doubts that Brighton, relative to the rest of the Country and despite some acute problems, is actually doing an above average job of helping all of its students, already. Something that should be being built upon, rather than being torn down."

    "text": "In 2024, all students in Brighton and Hove - both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged - achieved ABOVE the national (median) average when compared to other Local Authorities (both Upper and Lower Tier) in England. There is an attainment gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils in every Local Authority in England. Brighton’s is an artefact of non-disadvantaged students doing far better than average.\n\n\n\n\nDemand for schools varies significantly across the city. At the lower end, in the last 5-years, Longhill has received significantly fewer total applications (1st, 2nd and 3rd choice combined) than its Published Admission Number (PAN) of 270.\nOver the last 10 years (since 2014), Longhill’s total offers have been in steady decline every year, and it has never achieved anywhere near 270 offers. It’s peak was in 2019 when it made 225 offers. Last year it made 94 offers.\n\n\n\n\nSchool children in Brighton and Hove are not distributed evenly across the city and school locations do not match where pupils live, in some cases.\n\n\n\n\nBrighton and Hove’s student population will decline over the next decade. It is unlikely this decline will be even across the city\n\n\n\nSome children in Brighton and Hove under current catchment arrangements (particularly those who live in Whitehawk) don’t live near to any secondary school and have no option to walk to school. Most children from Whitehawk currently have to attend Longhill, which is a bus journey away.\nUnder Option B, significant numbers of children (estimates of up to 365 a day) from central Brighton would be forced to to travel 4-5 miles (6-8km) to attend school at Longhill. A journey which currently takes 1 to 1.5hrs on a bus, each way, so 2-3 hrs a day of travelling.\nAcross the whole of Europe, the average distance travelled to secondary school in Cities, Towns and Suburbs is less than 3km. On average, journeys of over 6km only occur in ‘sparse rural’ areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor disadvantaged student attainment in GCSE Maths and English, 24% achieved grade 9-5, ranking it 61st out of 153 Local Education Authorities (against a national median of 23%). With 27 of the top 28 being in London. Excluding London, Brighton ranks 30th best out of 122 Local Education Authorities in the rest of England for disadvantaged attainment at GCSE in 2024.\nBrighton ranks 35th out of 153 Local Education Authorities for non-disadvantaged attainment with 57.5% of students achieved grade 9-5 in English and Maths GCSE (against a national median of . Excluding London Boroughs (as Brighton already exceeds the performance of 10 boroughs) Brighton and Hove would rank 12th best out of the remaining 122 Local Education Authorities in the rest of England.\nThe relatively large size of the attainment gap in Brighton and Hove is due more to the higher levels of achievement of its non-disadvantaged students.\nThe Education Policy Institute - the leading research organisation in the UK in this area - using a more sophisticated measurement of gap (incorporating longitudinal disadvantage and ranking to reduce the biasing effects of London) - https://epi.org.uk/annual-report-2024-local-authority-gaps-2/ - shows that Brighton is one of the few local authorities in the UK to reduce its\n\nSource - Department for Education - https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-4-performance - table 2233_sl_lad_fsm_dis_data_revised.csv and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2021/06/access-and-cost-of-education-and-health-services_4889b7a5/full-report/component-7.html#figure-d1e11132 -"

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review-to-date">Review to Date</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to wade through my opinions, you may wish to jump straight to the new analysis below.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the ‘engagement exercise’ by the council, and frustrated by the evidence made available, I have made it my mission to try and fill the information vacuum with data and evidence collated, analysed and presented from a variety of different sources.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, I have produced two pieces of analysis (<a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html">here</a> and <a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/schools_wk2.html">here</a>) which have helped zoom in where the real issues in the system are. These can be summarised as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The spatial distribution of schools and places available in those schools, relative to where pupils actually live. Some (well, one as we’ll see below) of the schools in Brighton are simply in the wrong place (<a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html">piece 1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Illogical reductions in Published Admission Numbers for some schools and the maintenance of other, relative to current and future demand, driven largely by a desire to artificially prop up a school of the wrong size in the wrong location (<a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/schools_wk2.html">piece 2</a>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the effort taken in digging through the data and to unearly these issues means that I’ve not yet been able to address some of the other crucial parts of the story. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that the educational disadvantage partially caused by the spatial arrangement of current schools, is most keenly felt by those in the city who unfairly suffer from other forms of social and economic disadvantage - in particular residents of Whitehawk whose access to secondary education is poor. The issues raised by <a href="https://www.classdivide.co.uk/">Class Divide</a> around the closure of the COMART school in East Brighton in 2005 and their subsequent lack of accessibility to ANY secondary education in the city, let alone high-quality education, is very real.</li>
</ul>
<p>But in not being fully honest about all dimensions of problem - or possibly just ignorant of them - and in trying to portray the whole of the Brighton schools system as a problem, and a narrative of the ‘middle classes’ of north Brighton closing ranks to thwart a just cause (rather than a fundamentally flawed process), the whole community has been let down by the Council. I am now even more strongly of the opinion that the ‘solutions’ on the table are nothing of the sort and will only serve to do more harm than good.</p>
<section id="my-current-fears---i-hope-unfounded" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-current-fears---i-hope-unfounded">My Current Fears - I hope unfounded</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the exercise, I had real hope that the lack of information coming from the council was perhaps a mistake - an oversight due to an inexperienced or over-worked team. Unfortunately, as the weeks have gone by, and as I have listened to members of the council during the ‘engagement’ Q&amp;A sessions, the council are giving the impression that the lack of information is intentional. By not engaging with the requests for information and the clearly articulated fears of the community - and at worst, being dismissive of them - it feels like they have already made up their minds. It feels like an engagement in name only. I hope this is not the case.</p>
<p>Having reviewed all of the data I have gathered, it has become clear that only one option on the table - Option B (or something which looks a lot like it) - will result in the mass transition of students from the centre of the City, to Longhill in the East. A school which while once an appropriate size for a catchment stretching out towards Peacehaven, thanks to long-term demographic shifts (an ageing population and decline in families) no longer serves its original constituency. In recent years it’s cohorts of students have been swelled by children bussed out from Whitehawk in the East of the City - a demographic sticking plaster made easier to apply thanks to a population with less financial and social capital to resist.</p>
<p>To its credit, the Council - if not quite able to own up to its failures in closing COMART in 2005 - at least is now listening to that part of the city and has enacted a new policy to allow the very finanially worst off students - those on Free School Meals - to choose to study elsewhere in the city, should they wish. However, it’s clear that Option B is also the only option that stands to mitigate the inevitable effects of this policy, which will lead to still more students deserting Longhill. A policy that, if the council do rush through with a consultation immediately after the engagement period ends, won’t have had time to come to fruition or the initial results to be reviewed. It can be the only explanation for the haste with which council is proceeding.</p>
<p>I fear that in all of this, if the council pushes forward against the increasing weight of evidence, the people they are supposedly championing - those particularly in Whitehawk - will actually lose out in the long term. This is because, as I will show in some new analysis below - Longhill is poorly located and will continue to be poorly located, relative to where pupils live in the city. The council may try to argue that a new housing estate in Ovingdean will generate the demand required to keep Longhill afloat in the medium term, but as the numbers show below, unless this estate is the size of something like Whitehawk (it is far from that) it will be a drop in the ocean and barely move the dial. And the distraction of making a bad catchment system even worse, means that a real, sustainable, long-term, solution will be kicked down the road in favour of a poorly thought through short term solution, which is unlikely to work anyway.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-hopes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-hopes">My Hopes</h3>
<p>On the plus side, it is not too late for the council to take notice of the hundreds of good ideas and suggestions that are now emerging from individuals and self-organised groups in the city. I hope that they really do listen.</p>
<p>I hope that some of the evidence I have provided to fill the vacuum has helped some people understand what the underlying problem is a little better. And that armed with this information, they have felt emboldened to pose good questions to the council and make their voice heard.</p>
<p>I hope that the council takes the city up on its offer of help, whether through a Citizens Assembly, through the offers of help from experts who live in the city and care about it deeply.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Schools_2/schools_wk2.html">my last piece</a> I offered the council a viable option which would allow them to slow down and take an evidence-based approach. Myself and other members of the newly formed <a href="https://www.parentsupport.group/">Parent Support Group</a> intend to present the council with a worked through alternative to their current plans - and “Option D” if you like which will offer both a short-term and longer term sustainable alternatives to those that are currently on the table.</p>
<p>I hope that our proposals do buy the time the Council needs to do this properly. In my last piece I called for a systems thinking approach and I think this is the only way a lasting and sustainable solution can be reached. This will need to be carried out with a full range of view gathered from a Citizens Assembly - and idea I have seen recently promoted by Class Divide and one which was put to the council the last time they tried to re-draw the catchment boundaries, but one which clearly has not been enacted yet. And the council need to engage with a diverse and full range of expert views. It is great that the view of Prof Gorard and Dr Greaves were heard, and their educational perspective is important, but as I have shown this is as much a problem of geography and community, of flows and interactions, as it is of education. And there are hundreds of other voices with equally important perspectives that need to be heard.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-stain-on-our-city---or-a-badge-of-relative-achievement">“<strong><em>A Stain on our City</em></strong>” - or a badge of relative achievement?</h2>
<p>The phrase “<strong><em>A Stain on our City</em></strong>” has been in the back of my mind ever since it was used in reference to one of the opening slides that Jacob Taylor produced during the face-to-face consultation meeting on Tuesday 8/10/2024. It is highly a highly charged statement used as an oratorical device in making his case. Somebody pulled him up on the emotive language in the audience. Clearly taking this onboard he then went on to use it again in the People, Overview and Scrutiny Committee Meeting - it can be seen here near the opening of his speech - <a href="https://aisapps.mediasite.com/AuditelScheduler/Player/Index/?id=c1841cfa-af61-45cf-85b5-bb8d274e6b75&amp;presID=32ca1cfe29e14291be27a478fdbf76d01d" class="uri">https://aisapps.mediasite.com/AuditelScheduler/Player/Index/?id=c1841cfa-af61-45cf-85b5-bb8d274e6b75&amp;presID=32ca1cfe29e14291be27a478fdbf76d01d</a></p>
<p>As a reminder, this is the graph that he was referring to when he made these comments:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">A Stain On Our City?</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The ‘stain’ in this context is in reference to the 24% of Brighton &amp; Hove’s disadvantaged pupil population getting grade 5 or above in Maths and English. Being below the national figure of 25.4 for England constituted a “stain on our city” in JT’s mind. Strong stuff. Especially considering Brighton seems to be doing better than the rest of the South East region.</p>
<section id="but-is-it-really-a-stain-or-is-there-more-going-on" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-is-it-really-a-stain-or-is-there-more-going-on"><em>But is it really a “stain”, or is there more going on?</em></h4>
<p>Now, of course, comparing these figures with non-disadvantaged pupils, there is clearly a big attainment gap and narrowing this gap must be (and I am sure is) a priority for every local authority in the country. It’s not right that those from disadvantaged backgrounds do so much worse than their more advantaged peers.</p>
<p>But the argument Jacob Taylor was employing cast Brighton as a failure, relative to England. But is it Brighton really doing as badly as cast?</p>
<p>Two questions arise from this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is 24% as bad as is being portrayed if we examine some wider context?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the gap between 24% and 50% worse or better than anywhere else in the country?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In answering both of these questions, we can develop a clearer context for Brighton - which is really important as it underpins a lot of the arguments being made by the Council.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://social-mobility.data.gov.uk/intermediate_outcomes/compulsory_school_age_(5_to_16_years)/attainment_at_age_16/latest">the Government publishes data on attainment at age 16 across the country, according to social disadvantage</a>, so we can compare Brighton with a few more examples than just the national average, and the evidence is revealing.</p>

<p><strong><em>Figure 1 - Percentage of Students achieving Grade 5+ English and Maths, for disadvantaged (those in receipt of Free School Meals - left) and non-disadvantaged (right) students, 2022-23.</em></strong></p>
<p>There are a few features of note in this graph.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, there are 33 ‘Regions’ in this version of England. Brighton is within, and contributing to, the value of 21.4% for Surrey, East and West Sussex. Brighton, at 24%, is not only doing better than its wider region, but because it is not excluded from the regional figure, actually pulling its average <em>up</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, if Brighton were a region on this scale (ranked according to FSM achievement), it would sit between West Yorkshire (23.8% - ranked 10 of 33) and Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire (24.5% - ranked 9 of 33). In other words, it would fall in the <strong><em>top 1/3</em></strong> in England.</p></li>
<li><p>Thirdly, you may have noticed something interesting at the top of the graph - the top 5-regions that perform considerably better on the attainment of their pupils in receipt of Free School Meals, are all parts of London.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indeed London performs a full 10% better than the next ranked region and does a fantastic job of pulling the average up for the rest of the country. Which takes me back to the <a href="https://adamdennett.github.io/BH_Secondary_Admissions_Analysis/BH_Sec_Sch_Analysis.html#executive-summary">question I asked in my first piece of work on this topic</a> - why is London doing much better than Brighton and almost everywhere else in the Country? A question I can’t answer here, but one incredibly relevant to this whole issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Forthly, without London, the average 5-9 GCSE rate for disadvantaged pupils for the rest of the country reduces to <em>21%.</em> Against which Brighton is performing <strong><em>much better than average,</em></strong> and if it were one of these regions it would be, in the top 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally (and it might be easier to read across the table below to see this), the FSM / Non-FSM attainment gap in Brighton, according to the Council’s graph at the top of this piece, is 26%. As you can see in the table below - if Brighton were a region, this would rank 12th on this scale out of 33 - just outside the top 1/3.</p></li>

<section id="a-stain-on-our-city-conclusions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-stain-on-our-city-conclusions">A Stain on our City? Conclusions</h2>
<p>Hopefully what I have shown in this short exercise, is that <strong><em>context is everything</em></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compared the the national average for England, Brighton’s attainment at GCSE for pupils on Free School Meals is lower, <strong><em>however</em></strong>, that national average is being pulled up considerably by London, which is performing between 6.5% and 15.1% better than the best-performing non-London region.</p></li>
<li><p>If Brighton were one of these 33 regions, <strong><em>it woud still be achieving better results for pupils on FSM than 2/3 of other places in England</em></strong>. If we take London out of the equation, it would appear in the top 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Rather than being ‘a stain on our city’, it should be regared as a badge of pride that Brighon and Hove is able to achieve such good results for pupils in receipt of Free School Meals, relative to the rest of England.</p></li>
<li><p>If we look at the attainment gap between those who are on Free School Meals and those who aren’t as well, Brighton still performs far better than average, even with London in the equation. If Brighton were one of the regions above, it would be just outside the top 1/3.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The characterisation of Brighton and Hove’s ability to help it’s more deprived students as a ‘stain on the city’ is demonstrably unfair. And this kind of ‘cherry picking’ of statistics (where indeed statistics of any kind have been provided) to suit a particular line of argument has, sadly, characterised this whole ‘engagement’ process.</p>
<p>This ‘stain’ rhetoric plays a slightly more insidious role, however, in that is serves to distract from the very real problems of access and segretation to <em>do</em> exist in some parts of the city in particular concentrations - particularly in Whitehawk, but also in other parts of the city. Casting it as a problem for the whole city, serves the purpose of diverting attention away from the uncomfortable truth this is really a concentrated problem that needs a specific remedy (not the one on offer) and that in large parts of the city, disadvantaged children are doing better than in 2/3 of the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Having only 24% of students on Free School Meals achieve grade 5+ in GCSE Maths and English is <strong><em>not good</em></strong> - it is just better than almost everywhere else in the country. We should be striving to achieve something closer to the 42.1% achieved in Inner London - West. And it absolutely should be in the Council’s mission to improve further, but in doing so, getting a better understanding of the various factors at play in London (demographic, financial, geographical, educational etc.) and the specific routes to success and turnaround is crucial as then better solutions could be trialled here.</p>
